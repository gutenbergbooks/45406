<p><span class="smcap">Lawrence Severn</span>, an English writer, is bringing
out a novel entitled <i>Heaven's Gate: A Story of the
Forest of Dean</i>, of which the scenes are laid in and
about Chepstow Castle and Tintern Abbey. The critics
who have been permitted to read this in manuscript are
enthusiastic in pronouncing it a story of great strength
and exquisite style. D. Lothrop &amp; Co. announce it
for March.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Much</span> attention is attracted by the series of fine
historical drawings by Howard Pyle which are appearing
in this year's <span class="smcap">Wide Awake</span> in company with E. S.
Brooks' historical stories. Studies so conscientious of
time, costume and portraiture ennoble the illustrator's
calling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> proper place of the accent in the word "arbutus"
has excited much discussion. A rare instance of
its proper accentuation in poetry may be found in "The
Gift of Spring," a graceful bit of verse by Charles
Miner Thompson, which appears in <i>March</i> which D.
Lothrop &amp; Co. publish.</p>

<div class='drop-cap'>GRANDMA BURTON'S face was very
grave and sweet. "Yes," she said, "I
remember that third verse about as well as anything
that I ever learned; and it is queer how
the second one fits in with it. That finishes the
story; and I have had to wait more than sixty
years to think of it."</div>

<p>Marion and Ralph exchanged happy smiles.</p>

<p>"Then we two will have the story, Grandma,"
said Marion, "those are Ralph's and mine. But
I don't see how they fit."</p>

<p>"I do, child, they fit perfectly. It was the
summer I was eleven years old; we were boarding
in the country; I remember everything
about that summer, because I had some of the
nicest times, and some of the narrowest escapes
of my life.</p>

<p>"One day I went a-fishing, all by myself; I
wasn't what you might call a venturesome child,
so I was trusted in many places where careless
children could not have been." Grandma did
not even glance Ralph's way while she spoke;
so of course she could have meant no hint to
him! "I had some sandwiches in my bag left
of the lunch we had taken the day before. I
forgot to empty the bag; so when I was half-way
down the hill from our house I found them
in the way. It was a neat little bag, lined with
oilcloth; I could carry all sorts of things in it,
then turn it inside out, and wash it, and it would
come out as good as new. So I meant to fill the
bag with little fishes, and here were these sandwiches
in the way! Just as I turned the corner
by Mr. Willard's place, I heard a low growl, and
there stood Bose eying me in a way to make
my heart beat fast. I was dreadfully afraid of
Bose, and with good reason; he had the name of
being a very fierce dog; they kept him chained
all day. I saw the chain around his neck, then,
but still I was afraid. I was hurrying by, when
it occurred to me that here was a good chance
for getting rid of my sandwiches; if I could only
muster up courage to give them to Bose! I
turned back, and going as near to the fence as
I could, threw with all my strength, and landed
a piece of bread and meat at his feet. He gave
a low growl and eyed me so fiercely that all the
blood in my body seemed to go to my head;
but he smelled around the meat for a minute,
then took it in at one mouthful, and I tried again,
and again, until my bag was empty. He did not
growl at me any more, but I thought he looked
crosser than any dog ought to, who had been so
kindly treated.</p>

<p>"Presently, however, I forgot all about him;
some people would be surprised over what I was
thinking; they imagine that little girls never
think about sober things. But it was that very
verse which was in my mind: 'This beginning
of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and
manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed
on him.' Papa had read it at family
worship that morning, and he and mamma and
brother Mott had talked a little about it, and
set me to thinking. It didn't seem at all strange
to me that his disciples believed on him; I
thought if <i>I</i> could have a miracle worked for
me, I would find it easy, after that, to believe
anything. I remember exactly how I felt as I
sat on the bank with my feet hanging over, and
held in my hand a little fish about five inches
long; I was sorry for him and meant to throw
him back into the water, after I had examined
him; I thought he was too little to be caught;
as I sat holding him, I thought, 'If this fish
should turn into a beautiful little bird, just now,
and speak to me, then I would know that God
had done it, and I could believe in him, without
any trouble. I don't see why he doesn't do such
things now; it wouldn't be any stranger than
making wine out of water; and if it helped people
then, why shouldn't it now?' So I sat holding
that poor wriggling fish, and wishing he
would turn into a miracle before my eyes; but
he didn't, and presently I threw him back with
a sigh, and wound up my fish line, and went
around to the other side of the lake, still so busy
with my thoughts that I could not seem to settle
to anything. I don't know to this day, how
I came to do the next thing. I suppose I must
have gone a great deal nearer the edge than I
thought I was, and they said it was wet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
slippery there; anyway, I slipped and fell, and
trying to regain my balance I stepped on my
dress, and fell again, and rolled over into the
lake in less time than it takes me to tell it.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder you shiver," said Grandma
after a moment's pause, drawing Marion closer to
her. "It was a skittish place; the lake was pretty
deep in that part, and the banks were high and
slippery. It was not a time of day when people
were bathing, and there was nobody in sight. I
lost all knowledge of what was going on after
I sank the second time. When they found me,
where do you think I was? Dragged high
and dry from the lake, around to where the
ocean began, and that great Bose stood beside
me keeping guard and looking about him right
and left for help! He kept up such a fierce
barking that the boatmaster heard him at last,
and came to see what was the matter.</p>

<p>"The very first sentence that I fully understood,
of all the talk around me, was Mr. Willard
saying in a low tone: 'I declare, this seems
to me just like a miracle! I never knew Bose
to break his chain before; and I did not know
he would spring into the water for anybody;
in fact, I should have been afraid to send him,
for fear he would bite the child.'</p>

<p>"You can't imagine what a thrill it gave me!
'A miracle!' I said to myself; 'then He heard
me wishing for one, and promising I would believe
him fully, if He would only perform a
miracle for me; and He did it! It seemed just
like that to me then; and I'm not so sure but it
seems so yet. If the dear Lord was a mind to
humor your silly Grandma's unbelief and send
her a sign to strengthen her, why couldn't he do
it? Anyhow, nobody knows to this day, how
Bose got loose from his chain. It was found to
be not broken, only slipped in some way&mdash;and
no one knows who told him to bound down to
the lake and spring into the water just in time
to save me. He wasn't what is commonly called
a water dog; and he was very fierce to children
generally. Some folks think such things just
happen; but I've lived a great many years, and
the longer I live the surer I am that there isn't
much 'happening' of any kind about our lives.
There wasn't any need for me having a miracle,
children; the Lord had done enough for me long
before, but he is sometimes real patient with silly
people. I know I began that very day to try
to serve him, and I've always been glad I did."</p>

<p>The listeners were very quiet for some minutes,
then Ralph spoke: "I don't see my verse
fitting in anywhere, Grandma?"</p>

<p>"But it did," said Grandma, nodding her
head. "I was sick all that summer. The shock,
they said, was too much for me; I couldn't walk
a step for a long time. I used to sit in a big
chair out of doors, with Bose by my side; he
was the greatest friend I had. No more growls
for me; and he wouldn't growl at anybody I
told him not to.</p>

<p>"One day Rob Carleton and his sister stopped
at the gate to visit with me; they were from the
same city where we lived; but I didn't know
them much at home. Rob began to tell me
how queer he thought it was that that dog
should have come after me, when he had always
before acted as though he hated children;
and something whispered to me to tell him about
my little miracle. I didn't quite want to. I
was afraid he might laugh at me; but at last I
mustered up courage, and told him the whole
story. He didn't laugh at all; but he didn't say
much of anything, and by and by went away.
They left the shore the next day; and I did not
see that boy again for five years; and then, don't
you think he told me that ever since I told him
about my miracle, he couldn't get away from
the thought of such things, and at last it led him
to decide to belong to Jesus, and he led his little
sister May in the same direction! Why, you
children have often heard me speak of Doctor
Carleton, the missionary in India? He's the
very same! And May is a minister's wife in
Kansas. Don't you see your verse, Ralph?
'The two disciples heard Him speak, and they
followed Jesus.' Rob and May weren't <i>disciples</i>
yet, but the dear Lord knew they were going to
be; and he let me tell about my little miracle,
and used it to help them decide to follow him."</p>

<p>One day when Susie was visiting her great-aunt,
she found in one of her old books an excellent
rule. It was this: "Aim to make courtesies
not an article of dress to put off and on,
but a part of ourselves&mdash;something that is always
with us."</p>

<h2>BOB'S FIRST PRAYER.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-o.jpg" width="57" height="112" alt="O" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">ONE summer they carried May Vinton to
a quiet place by the sea. From the
windows of her room she could watch
the unceasing roll of the waves, she
could mark the incoming and outgoing
tide; she grew to love the sea and did not
seem to miss the coming and going of friends
which she enjoyed so much in her own home.
But she missed opportunities for helping others.
At least she did at first, but she was not long in
finding some one who needed her. It was the
boy from the fisherman's little cottage whose
acquaintance she first made. He came every
morning with fish for her breakfast, and May,
calling to him as he passed her window with his
basket, soon found out that he lived in the little
low-roofed building which she could just see
quite a long way down the shore; and she found
out that there were several children in the family
and that the father went out every day in a
boat after fish. She gathered that while they
were not suffering for food and clothes, they
were still quite poor, and that the children had
never been to school and were very ignorant of
the knowledge gained from books. The boy could
tell her all about the fishing business, about the
ways of the old ocean, he knew where to look
for the prettiest shells and the finest seaweed.
He could tell what the winds and the shifting
clouds portended as to the weather, but not a
letter of the
alphabet did
he know.</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 506px;">
<img src="images/illus12.jpg" width="506" height="399" alt="fishermen, boat and many seagulls" />
<div class="caption">SHE COULD WATCH THE WAVES FROM HER WINDOW.</div>
</div>

<p>"Would you
like to learn to
read?" asked
May.</p>

<p>The little fellow
was not
sure, but he did
want to hear a
story, and so
she began that
way, interesting
the boy in
a story. He
soon became a
regular visitor.
Leaning upon
the window-sill
he would
listen to his
new friend as
she talked, telling
him of
things outside
the little world which he knew. At length
she said, "To-morrow will be Sunday; suppose
you bring your sister and brother for a little
while in the afternoon and we will have a little
Sunday-school."</p>

<p>"Sunday-school! What's that?"</p>

<p>"Come and see."</p>

<p>"Can I bring Tommy Britt?"</p>

<p>"You may bring four besides yourself."</p>

<p>And so Miss Vinton began a little Sunday-school
down there by the sea with five scholars.
You who have so often heard the sweet old
story of a Saviour's love cannot imagine what it
was to these ignorant children to hear it for the
first time. You to whom the words of the prayer
which Christ taught us have been familiar from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
your babyhood, cannot know how strange were
the thoughts and words of that prayer, nor what
a hold upon their imaginations the idea of asking
anything of an unseen being took.</p>

<p>The summer months passed away. Miss Vinton
took leave of her little class and went back
to her own home. She said sadly, "They are
so ignorant! It was so little that I could do for
them; and I am afraid they will forget it all."</p>

<div class="caption">THE WIFE AND CHILDREN BEGAN TO BE ANXIOUS.</div>
</div>

<p>Did they forget? One November morning
the fisherman went out in his boat as usual;
later in the day the clouds gathered as for a
storm, and the wife and children began to be
anxious. As the afternoon hours waned the sky
grew darker, and the wind howled about the
little cottage. It was already past the hour
when the father might have been expected, and
poor Mrs. Byrnes soothed the fretful baby and
turned her eyes anxiously towards the window
which looked seaward. The children peered out
into the gathering darkness, but no sail was in
sight; indeed it soon became so dark that they
could not see far from the house. Little Nell
placed a lamp in the window and Bob replenished
the fire. Then he slipped away. A bit of
the conversation which the younger ones had
carried on as they stood gazing out over the
waters, had given him an idea.</p>

<p>"Don't you know," said Nell, "how Miss Vinton
said 'the sea is His and He made it?'"</p>

<p>"Yes; and you know she told us the pretty
story of how the people were afraid and Jesus
said to the waves, 'be still.' I liked that story!"
said the little brother.</p>

<p>"I wish He would say so to the waves now,"
returned Nell.</p>

<p>"Maybe He would if he were here," was the
reply. "Maybe He would. I wish he was here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob hearing this remembered more of the
teachings of the young lady of whom they had
all been so fond, and as soon as he could, he
slipped away and went up into the loft where
the children slept. There in the darkness and
chill he knelt down and asked Jesus to make the
winds and waves "be still." Repeating this,
his first prayer, again and again, he at length
arose with a calm in his heart. Going down
stairs his mother said: "Seems to me the wind
does not blow quite so hard."</p>

<p>Bob smiled and whispered, "I shouldn't wonder
if He heard! I didn't know as he would
hear <i>me</i>, but Miss Vinton said He would."</p>

<p>He piled on more fuel, saying aloud, "Father
will be here soon, and we must have it warm
and have supper ready. Mother, don't you think
we ought to set the table?"</p>

<p>"O yes, I suppose so. But I thought if your
father never comes home, we would not want any
supper," said the poor woman, in a despairing
tone.</p>

<p>"I know; but don't you think the wind has
gone down considerably?"</p>

<p>It seemed ages to the waiting group, but it
was not more than an hour when the voice of the
fisherman was heard, and Bob throwing open
the door welcomed the father.</p>

<p>"I tell you," said the dripping man, "I began
to think I should never see the shore again!
The storm was awful, but about an hour ago, it
began to let up a little. The clouds broke away
too, and then I saw Nell's light there, and I tell
you we just steered for that!"</p>

<p>"About an hour ago," repeated Bob to himself.
"That was when I was up there asking
Jesus to say 'be still.' I guess he did hear!"</p>

<h2>AN EASTER STORY.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="59" height="112" alt="T" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi4">"THERE comes Prinkie!" and the girls in
Miss Winthrop's class made room for
the new-comer. This was a rosy-cheeked
girl with sparkling black eyes and, what
the girls noticed particularly, a new hat.
Prinkie Brown, as they called her, reveled in
new hats. She had a new one for Thanksgiving,
another for Christmas, one when her mother
came from New York, and now at Easter she
was out in still another! Old Mrs. Brown was
wont to say: "Prinkie is chock full of vanity
and ought not to be indulged in her love of fine
clothes;" but Mr. Brown was a rich man, and
seldom refused to gratify any desire or whim of
either wife or daughter, and so Prinkie had new
hats and dresses to her heart's content. No, I am
mistaken.</div>

<p>When did new hats or new dresses ever give
any one a contented heart? True, to look into
the young girl's face you might think she was
very happy; but her happiness was short-lived.
A whisper reached her ears.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see such a vain girl?" said
Ella Clark to the girl next to her.</p>

<p>"No; Prinkie grows more like a peacock
every day. I don't believe she ever thinks of
anything beyond new clothes."</p>

<p>"Now you watch her. When Miss Winthrop
asks her a question she simpers and looks
down at her gloves and smooths her laces as if
she thought those things were the most important."</p>

<p>"I suppose she does think <i>just that!</i>"</p>

<p>Now Prinkie did not hear all of this, but she
caught enough of it to understand the drift of
the talk, and she was angry and mortified.
"Like a peacock," indeed! Was a girl to be
called names because she had a new hat? When
would one wear new clothes if not on Easter
Sunday? Was not the church and Sunday-school
room tastefully decorated? It was real
mean of those girls to spoil her enjoyment of her
new hat by such ill-natured remarks. True she
had not been quite satisfied. Her gloves were not
an exact match for the hat, and she had pouted
a little that morning over the fact, and grandma
had vexed her by saying "Mary"&mdash;her real
name is Mary&mdash;"Mary, I am afraid that in
dressing for the day you are thinking more of
yourself and too little of the meaning of Easter."</p>

<p>Was it true, as they all seemed to think, that
she thought of nothing else than her clothes?
What was the superintendent saying: "Let
us not lose sight of the event we celebrate to-day.
We would be miserable indeed were it
not for this most glorious truth that our Christ
is not a dead Christ, but a living Saviour. And
in our admiration and enjoyment of these decorations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
these floral offerings which you have
brought, in these symbols let us not forget what
we symbolize. The resurrection of Jesus Christ
our Lord is our theme; let us sing with joyful
voice:</p>

<div class='poem'>
Hail, all hail, victorious Lord and Saviour,<br />
Thou hast burst the bonds of death!"<br />
</div>

<p>Prinkie sang with the rest, and only Miss Winthrop
noticed the troubled expression which
rested upon the young girl's face. Miss Winthrop
was very much troubled about her class;
they were girls from twelve to fifteen years old.
Some of them were church members, but nearly
all seemed given over to frivolity. During the
winter just passed there had been some religious
interest in other classes in the school, yet these
girls, absorbed in school, children's parties, and
dress, had frittered the time away, and, so far as
their teacher could see, had made little progress
in the divine life. She had come before them
this Easter morning with a heavily burdened
heart. She had prayed that they might awaken
to a newness of life, that the Easter lessons might
sink into their hearts, that the shackles of sin
and frivolity which held them might be broken,
that they might henceforth abound in the fruits
of righteousness. And now as she listened to
their chatter and noticed their enjoyment of
their fluttering ribbons, and heard the light
tinkle of their bangles, she sighed over the apparent
failure of her hopes for them. She turned
towards them at the beginning of the lesson-hour,
saying:</p>

<p>"Girls, we ought to be very bright and happy
this morning, else we should be very sad. If we
have a part in this rejoicing, if it is <i>our</i> Saviour
of whom we sing 'The Lord is risen indeed'
then we have a right to be glad. If He who is
risen is one whom we have rejected, then we
have no call to rejoice; why should we care?
Some of us have professed to be his friends, and
the nearer we have been living to him, the more
faithful to our vows we have been, the more
precious He is to our hearts, the more we may
rejoice in the truth of the resurrection. Whether
we have hitherto been living for Christ or not,
this is a good time to begin anew. 'Like as
Christ was raised up from the dead, even so we
also should walk in newness of life.' Let us put
away old things that have been hindering us and
serve in newness of spirit. Let this be a real
true Easter to every one of us." There was
more of that earnest talk and it seemed to sink
into the hearts of those who heard it. I can
only tell you how one acted upon the lessons of
the day. The hardest lesson had been the whispered
words which she overheard; but the tender
pleading of Miss Winthrop had softened
her and she walked homeward alone, having
turned away from the fluttering group. She
was thinking:</p>

<p>"The girls call me vain&mdash;and say I am like
a peacock, and Miss Winthrop is sad over me,
and all for the same reason. I don't like to
have the girls talk about me, and I don't like
to have Miss Winthrop sad; I wonder if I
am such a giddy girl! I suppose it is true;
I do think too much of dress. I suppose I might
look nice without thinking so much about it and
without showing that I do. Miss Winthrop
talked about newness of life&mdash;I wish I could be
made over all new. Then I wouldn't be Mary
Brown. Yes, I might; I am <i>Prinkie</i> Brown
now. I won't be called Prinkie any more. I'll
be Mary, and I will live for something better
than dress."</p>

<p>"Prinkie," called Mrs. Brown as the young
girl came down stairs after putting away the
new hat which had become less precious.</p>

<p>"Mamma, please do not call me that any more.
And will you please not let any one else call me
so? I hate the name and I am going to be Mary
Brown after this."</p>

<p>Mary could not tell her mother that she had
resolved to "walk in newness of life," for Mrs.
Brown was not a religious woman, and the child
felt that she would not understand her. But to
her grandmother she said as she lingered in her
room at evening:</p>

<p>"Grandmamma, this has been a true Easter to
me!"</p>

<p>This was a year ago, and Mary Brown still
wears new hats, from time to time, and still
dresses as seems to befit the daughter of a man
of wealth, but no one calls her "Prinkie." No
one would think of comparing her to a peacock;
for she walks in newness of life; every Sabbath
is to her a glad Easter.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="59" height="112" alt="T" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">THE little old grandmothers with their
queer caps were perhaps the feature of
the evening. Everybody wanted a bouquet
of them. In fact, long before
eight o'clock, Jerry had been hurried
away for a fresh supply, and Nettie had been
established behind a curtain, in haste, to "make
more grandmothers." In her excitement she
made them even prettier than before; and sweet,
grave little Sate had no trouble in selling every
one. The pretty Roman flower girl was so much
admired, that her father, a fine-looking young
mechanic who came after her bringing red stockings
and neat shoes, carried her off at last in triumph
on his shoulder, saying he was afraid her
head would be turned with so much praise, but
thanking everybody with bright smiling eyes for
giving his little girl such a pleasant afternoon.</div>

<p>"She isn't Irish, after all," said Irene Lewis,
watching them. "And Mr. Sherrill shook
hands with him as familiarly as though he was
an old friend; I wish we hadn't made such simpletons
of ourselves. Lorena Barstow, what did
you want to go and say she was an Irish girl
for?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say any such thing," said Lorena in
a shrill voice; and then these two who had been
friends in ill humor all the afternoon quarreled,
and went home more unhappy than before.
And still I tell you they were not the worst girls
in the world; and were very much ashamed of
themselves.</p>

<p>Before eight o'clock, Norm came. To be sure
he stoutly refused, at first, to step beyond the
doorway, and ordered Nettie in a somewhat
surly tone to "bring that young one out," if she
wanted her carried home. That, of course, was
the little grandmother; but her eyes looked as
though they had not thought of being sleepy,
and the ladies were not ready to let her go.
Then the minister, who seemed to understand
things without having them explained, said,
"Where is Decker? we'll make it all right;
come, little grandmother, let us go and see about
it." So he took Sate on his shoulder and made
his way through the crowd; and Nettie who
watched anxiously, presently saw Norm coming
back with them, not looking surly at all; his
clothes had been brushed, and he had on a clean
collar, and his hair was combed, quite as though
he had meant to come in, after all.</p>

<p>Soon after Norm's coming, something happened
which gave Nettie a glimpse of her
brother in a new light. Young Ernest Belmont
was there with his violin. During the afternoon,
Nettie had heard whispers of what a
lovely player he was, and at last saw with delight
that a space was being cleared for him to
play. Crowds of people gathered about the
platform to listen, but among them all Norm's
face was marked; at least it was to Nettie.
She had never seen him look like that. He
seemed to forget the crowds, and the lights, and
everything but the sounds which came from that
violin. He stood perfectly still, his eyes never
once turning from their earnest gaze of the fingers
which were producing such wonderful tones.
Nettie, looking, and wondering, almost forgot
the music in her astonishment that her brother
should be so absorbed. Jerry with some difficulty
elbowed his way towards her, his face
beaming, and said, "Isn't it splendid?"</p>

<p>For answer she said, "Look at Norm." And
Jerry looked.</p>

<p>"That's so," he said at last, heartily, speaking
as though he was answering a remark from
somebody; "Norm is a musician. Did you
know he liked it so much?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know anything about it," Nettie
said, hardly able to keep back the tears, though
she did not understand why her eyes should fill;
but there was such a look of intense enjoyment
in Norm's face, mingled with such a wistful
longing for something, as made the tears start
in spite of her. "I didn't know he liked <i>anything</i>
so much as that."</p>

<p>"He likes <i>that</i>," said Jerry heartily, "and I
am glad."</p>

<p>"I don't know. What makes you glad? I
am almost sorry; because he may never have a
chance to hear it again."</p>

<p>"He must make his chances; he is going to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
a man. I'm glad, because it gives us a hint as
to what his tastes are; don't you see?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Nettie, "I see he likes it;
but what is the use in knowing people's tastes if
you cannot possibly do anything for them?"</p>

<p>"There's no such thing as it not being possible
to do most anything." Jerry said good humoredly.
"Maybe we will some of us own a violin
some day, and Norm will play it for us. Who
knows? Stranger things than that have happened."</p>

<p>But this thing looked to Nettie so improbable
that she merely laughed. The music suddenly
ceased, and Norm came back from dreamland
and looked about him, and blushed, and felt
awkward. He saw the people now, and the
lights, and the flowers; he remembered his
hands and did not know what to do with them;
and his feet felt too large for the space they must
occupy.</p>

<p>Jerry plunged through the crowd and stood
beside him.</p>

<p>"How did you like it?" he asked, and Norm
cleared his voice before replying; he could not
understand why his throat should feel so husky.</p>

<p>"I like a fiddle," he said. "There is a fellow
comes into the corner grocery down there by
Crossman's and plays, sometimes; I always go
down there, when I hear of it."</p>

<p>If Jerry could have caught Nettie's eye just
then he would have made a significant gesture;
the store by Crossman's made tobacco and
liquor its chief trade. So a fiddle was one of
the things used to draw the boys into it!</p>

<p>"Is a fiddle the only kind of music you like?"
Jerry had been accustomed to calling it a violin,
but the instinct of true politeness which was
marked in him, made him say fiddle just now as
Norm had done.</p>

<p>"Oh! I like anything that whistles a tune!"
said Norm. "I've gone a rod out of my way to
hear a jew's-harp many a time; even an old hand-organ
sounds nice to me. I don't know why,
but I never hear one without stopping and listening
as long as I can." He laughed a little, as
though ashamed of the taste, and looked at Jerry
suspiciously. But there was not the slightest
hint of a smile on the boy's face, only hearty interest
and approval.</p>

<p>"I like music, too, almost any sort; but I
don't believe I like it as well as you. Your face
looked while you were listening as though you
could make some yourself if you tried."</p>

<p>The smile went out quickly from Norm's face,
and Jerry thought he heard a little sigh with the
reply:</p>

<p>"I never had a chance to try; and never expect
to have."</p>

<p>"Well, now, I should like to know why not?
I never could understand why a boy with brains,
and hands, and feet, shouldn't have a try at
almost anything which was worth trying, sometime
in his life." It was not Jerry who said
this, but the minister who had come up in time
to hear the last words from both sides. He
stopped before Norm, smiling as he spoke.
"Try the music, my friend, by all means, if you
like it. It is a noble taste, worth cultivating."</p>

<p>Norm looked sullen. "It's easy to talk," he
said severely, "but when a fellow has to work
like a dog to get enough to eat and wear, to
keep him from starving or freezing, I'd like to
see him get a chance to try at music, or anything
else of that kind!"</p>

<p>"So should I. He is the very fellow who ought
to have the chance; and more than that, in nine
cases out of ten he is the fellow who gets it. A
boy who is willing and able to work, is pretty
sure, in this country, to have opportunity to
gratify his tastes in the end. He may have to
wait awhile, but that only sharpens the appetite
of a genuine taste; if it is a worthy taste, as
music certainly is, it will grow with his growth,
and will help him to plan, and save, and contrive,
until one of these days he will show you! By
the way, you would like organ music, I fancy;
the sort which is sometimes played on parlor
organs. If you will come to the parsonage to-morrow
night at eight o'clock, I think I can
promise you something which you will enjoy.
My sister is going to try some new music for a
few friends, at that time; suppose you come and
pick out your favorite?"</p>

<p>All Jerry's satisfaction and interest shone in
his face; to-morrow night at eight o'clock! All
day he had been trying to arrange something
which would keep Norm at that hour away from
the aforesaid corner grocery, where he happened
to know some doubtful plans were to be arranged
for future mischief, by the set who gathered there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
If only Norm would go to the parsonage it would
be the very thing. But Norm flushed and hesitated.
"Bring a friend with you," said the
minister. "Bring Jerry, here; you like music,
don't you, Jerry?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Jerry promptly; "I like
music very much, and I would like to go if
Norm is willing."</p>

<p>"Bring Jerry with you." That sentence had a
pleasant sound. Up to this moment it was the
younger boy who had patronized the elder.
Norm called him the "little chap," but for all
that looked up to him with a curious sort of respect
such as he felt for none of the "fellows"
who were his daily companions; the idea of
bringing him to a place of entertainment had its
charms.</p>

<p>"May I expect you?" asked the minister,
reading his thoughts almost as plainly as though
they had been printed on his face, and judging
that this was the time to press an acceptance.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Norm, "I suppose so."</p>

<p>One of these days Norman Decker will not
think of accepting an invitation with such words,
but his intentions are good, now, and the minister
thanks him as though he had received a
favor, and departs well pleased.</p>

<div class="caption">STUDYING THE EGGSHELL.</div>
</div>

<p>And now it is really growing late and little
Sate must be carried home. It was an evening
to remember.</p>

<p>They talked it over by inches the next morning.
Nettie finishing the breakfast dishes, and
Jerry sitting on the doorstep fashioning a bracket
for the kitchen lamp.</p>

<p>Nettie talked much about Ermina Farley.
"She is just as lovely and sweet as she can be.
It was beautiful in her to come over to me as
she did when she came into that yard; part of
it was for little Trudie's sake, and a great deal
of it was for my sake. I saw that at the time;
and I saw it plainer all the afternoon. She
didn't give me a chance to feel alone once; and
she didn't stay near me as though she felt she
ought to, but didn't want to, either; she just
took hold and helped do everything Miss Sherrill
gave me to do, and was as bright and sweet
as she could be. I shall never forget it of her.
But for all that," she added as she wrung out
her dishcloth with an energy which the small
white rag hardly needed, "I know it was pretty
hard for her to do it, and I shall not give her a
chance to do it again."</p>

<p>"I want to know what there was hard
about it?" said Jerry, looking up in astonishment.
"I thought Ermina Farley seemed to be
having as good a time as anybody there."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, well now, I know, you are not a girl;
boys are different from girls. They are not so
kind-of-mean! At least, some of them are not,"
she added quickly, having at that moment a
vivid recollection of some mean things which
she had endured from boys. "Really I don't
think they are," she said, after a moment's
thoughtful pause, and replying to the quizzical
look on his face. "They don't think about
dresses, and hats, and gloves, and all those
sorts of things as girls do, and they don't say
such hateful things. Oh! I <i>know</i> there is a
great difference; and I know just how Ermina
Farley will be talked about because she went
with me, and stood up for me so; and I think
it will be very hard for her. I used to think so
about you, but you&mdash;are real different from
girls!"</p>

<p>"It amounts to about this," said Jerry, whittling
gravely. "Good boys are different from
bad girls, and bad boys are different from good
girls."</p>

<p>Nettie laughed merrily. "No," she said, "I
do know what I am talking about, though you
don't think so; I know real splendid girls who
couldn't have done as Ermina Farley did yesterday,
and as you do all the time; and what I say
is, I don't mean to put myself where she will
<i>have</i> to do it, much. I don't want to go to their
parties; I don't expect a chance to go, but if I
had it, I wouldn't go; and just for her sake, I
don't mean to be always around for her to have
to take care of me as she did yesterday. I have
something else to do."</p>

<p>Said Jerry, "Where do you think Norm is going
to take me this evening?"</p>

<p>"Norm going to take you!" great wonderment
in the tone. "Why, where could he take
you? I don't know, I am sure."</p>

<p>"He is to take me to the parsonage at eight
o'clock to hear some wonderful music on the
organ. He has been invited, and has had permission
to bring me with him if he wants to.
Don't you talk about not putting yourself where
other people will have to take care of you! I
advise you to cultivate the acquaintance of your
brother. It isn't everybody who gets invited to
the parsonage to hear such music as Miss Sherrill
can make."</p>

<p>The dishcloth was hung away now, and every
bit of work was done. Nettie stood looking at
the whittling boy in the doorway for a minute
in blank astonishment, then she clasped her
hands and said: "O Jerry! Did they do it?
Aren't they the very splendidest people you ever
knew in your life?"</p>

<p>"They are pretty good," said Jerry, "that's a
fact; they are most as good as my father. I'll
tell you what it is, Nettie, if you knew my
father you would know a man who would be
worth remembering. I had a letter from him
last night, and he sent a message to my friend
Nettie."</p>

<p>"What?" asked Nettie, her eyes very bright.</p>

<p>"It was that you were to take good care of
his boy; for in his opinion the boy was worth
taking care of. On the strength of that I want
you to come out and look at Mother Speckle;
she is in a very important frame of mind, and
has been scolding her children all the morning.
I don't know what is the trouble; there are two
of her daughters who seem to have gone astray
in some way; at least she is very much displeased
with them. Twice she has boxed Fluffie's
ears, and once she pulled a feather out
of poor Buff. Look at her, how forlorn she
seems!"</p>

<p>By this time they were making their way to
the little house where the hen lived, Nettie
agreeing to go for a very few minutes, declaring
that if Norm was going out every evening there
was work to do. He would need a clean collar
and she must do it up; for mother had gone
out to iron for the day. "Mother is so grateful
to Mrs. Smith for getting her a chance to work,"
she said, as they paused before the two disgraced
chickens; "she says she would never have
thought of it if it had not been for her; you
know she always used to sew. Why, how funny
those chickens look! Only see, Jerry, they are
studying that eggshell as though they thought
they could make one. Now don't they look exactly
as though they were planning something?"</p>

<p>"They are," said Jerry. "They are planning
going to housekeeping, I believe; you see they
have quarreled with their mother. They consider
that they have been unjustly punished, and
I am in sympathy with them; and they believe
they could make a house to live in out of that
eggshell if they could only think of a way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
stick it together again. I wish <i>we</i> could build a
house out of eggshells; or even one room, and
we'd have one before the month was over."</p>

<p>"Why?" said Nettie, stooping down to see
why Buff kept her foot under her. "Do you
want a room, Jerry?"</p>

<p>"Somewhat," said Jerry. "At least I see a
number of things we could do if we had a room,
that I don't know how to do without one. Come
over here, Nettie, and sit down; leave those
chickens to sulk it out, and let us talk a little. I
have a plan so large that there is no place to
put it."</p>

<h2>HOW A SMALL BOY GOT HIS RIGHTS.</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>BIG men are not always just or generous,
and many times the small boy is a sufferer
at their hands. Sometimes the big man is
cross because he has eaten too much dinner&mdash;the
small boy will understand now how uncomfortable
he feels&mdash;and as he is too big to
cry he vents his ill humor, many times, on the
first small boy who comes in his way. Now,
you know that some people think that if you
eat too much meat you will become savage, and,
as this man who was unjust to the small boy was
a butcher, perhaps he had eaten so much meat
that he had become in part a savage. In one of
the police-courts up-town, in New York, one
morning, not long since, a very small boy in
knickerbockers, appeared. He had a dilapidated
cap in one hand and a green cotton bag in the
other. Behind him came a big policeman with
a grin on his face. When the boy found himself
in the court-room he hesitated and looked as
if he would like to retreat, but as he half-turned
and saw the grin on his escort's face, he shut his
lips tighter and meandered up to the desk.</div>

<p>"Please, sir, are you the judge?" he asked, in
a voice that had a queer little quiver in it.</p>

<p>"I am, my boy; what can I do for you?"
asked the Justice, as he looked wonderingly
down at the mite before him.</p>

<p>"If you please, sir, I'm Johnny Moore. I'm
seven years old, and I live in One Hundred and
Twenty-third street, near the avenue, and the
only good place to play miggles on is in front of
a lot near our house, where the ground is smooth;
but a butcher on the corner," and here his voice
grew steady and his cheeks flushed, "that hasn't
any more right to the place than we have, keeps
his wagon standing there, and this morning we
were playing miggles there, and he drove us
away, and took six of mine, and threw them
away off over the fence into the lot, and I went
to the police station, and they laughed at me,
and told me to come here and tell you about it."</p>

<p>The big policeman and the spectators began
to laugh boisterously, and the complainant at
the bar trembled so violently with mingled indignation
and fright that the marbles in his little
green bag rattled together.</p>

<p>The Justice, however, rapped sharply on the
desk, and quickly brought everybody to dead
silence. "You did perfectly right, my boy,"
said he gravely, "to come here and tell me about
it. You have as much right to your six marbles
as the richest man in this city has to his bank
account. If every American citizen had as much
regard for their rights as you show there would
be far less crime. And you, sir," he added,
turning to the big policeman, who now looked as
solemn as a funeral, "you go with this little man
to that butcher and make him pay for those
marbles, or else arrest him and bring him here."</p>

<p>You see this boy knew that his rights had
been interfered with, and he went to the one
having authority to redress his wrongs. He did
not throw stones or say naughty words, but in
a manly, dignified way demanded his rights.&mdash;<i>Selected.</i></p>

<div class='poem'><div class='drop-cap'>
AN angel's thought flew down to earth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Borne on a golden beam of light;</span><br />
And pausing, rested in the heart<br />

<br />
And finding there a flower-soul<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Free from all taint of earthly pride,</span><br />
The angel's thought would fain remain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in the Pansy still doth hide.</span><br />
<br />
And so these gold and purple flowers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The soft-eyed Pansies which we love,</span><br />
Sprang from the violet which received<br />

<h2>POEM FOR RECITATION.</h2>

<h3>EASTER.</h3>

<div class='poem'><div class='drop-cap'>
MY sweet little neighbor Bessie<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I thought was busy with play,</span><br />
When she turned, and brightly questioned,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Say, what is the Easter day?"</span><br />
<br />
"Has nobody told you, darling&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Do they 'Feed His Lambs' like this?"</span><br />
I gathered her to my bosom,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And gave her a tender kiss.</span><br />
<br />
Away went the cloak for dolly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And away went dolly too,</span><br />
As again she eagerly questioned,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With eyes so earnest and blue:</span><br />
<br />
"Is it like birthdays or Christmas&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or like Thanksgiving Day;</span><br />
Do we just be good like Sunday,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or run and frolic and play?</span><br />
<br />
"I know there's flowers to it,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And that is most all I know;</span><br />
I've got a lovely rosebush,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a bud begins to grow."</span><br />
<br />
Then in words most few and simple<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I told to the gentle child</span><br />
The story whose end is Easter&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Life of the Undefiled.</span><br />
<br />
Told of the manger of Bethlehem,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And about the glittering star</span><br />
That guided the feet of the shepherds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Watching their flocks from afar,</span><br />
<br />
Told of the lovely Mother,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the Baby who was born</span><br />
To live on the earth among us<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bearing its sorrows and scorn.</span><br />
<br />
And then I told of the life He lived<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those wonderful thirty years,</span><br />
Sad, weary, troubled, forsaken,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In this world of sin and tears,</span><br />
<br />
Until I came to the shameful death<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That the Lord of Glory died,</span><br />
Then the tender little maiden<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Uplifted her voice and cried.</span><br />
<br />
I came at length to the garden<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where they laid His form away,</span><br />
And then in the course of telling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I came to the Easter day&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
The day when sorrowing women<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Came there to the grave to moan,</span><br />
And the lovely shining angels<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had rolled away the stone.</span><br />
<br />
I think I made her understand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As well as childhood can,</span><br />
About the glorified risen life<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of him who was God and Man.</span><br />
<br />
This year the fair Easter lilies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will gleam through a mist of tears,</span><br />
For I shall not see sweet Bessie<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In all of the coming years.</span><br />
<br />
When the snow lay white and thickest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She quietly went away</span><br />
To learn from the lips of angels<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The meaning of Easter day.</span><br />
<br />
We put on the little body<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The garments worn in life,</span><br />
And laid her deep in the frozen earth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Away from all noise and strife.</span><br />
<br />
We took all the dainty playthings,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the dollies new and old,</span><br />
And placed them in a sacred spot<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a tress of shining gold.</span><br />
<br />
Were it not for the star of Bethlehem,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the dawn of Easter day,</span><br />
It would be to us most bitter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To put our darling away.</span><br />
<br />
But we know that as the hard brown earth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Holds lilies regal and white,</span><br />
So the lifeless, empty, useless clay<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Held once an angel of light.</span><br />
<br />
And I hope on the Easter morning<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To look from the grave away,</span><br />
Thinking not of the child that <i>was</i>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the child that <i>is</i> to-day.</span><br />

<h2>WHERE I WENT, AND WHAT I SAW.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-f.jpg" width="57" height="111" alt="F" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">FIRST, through some of the busiest, narrowest,
noisiest, dirtiest streets of New
York City; if you have never hurried
down them, you have no idea how much
that means. A ferry boat, a bit of a ride,
and I was in New York no more, but in New
Jersey. The Jersey Central train stood waiting.</div>

<p>"All aboard for Long Branch," shouted an
official. I did not want to go to Long Branch,
but I hurried along as fast as though I did; the
truth was, I knew my stopping place was not
far away from that famous spot. In a few minutes
we were off; not long before the smell of
old ocean began to steal in at the windows, and
at last we caught glimpses of beach stretching
away in the distance.</p>

<p>Not a long ride, only a matter of a couple of
hours on an express train, despite the many stations
called out: "Matawan," and "Red Bank,"
and "Little Silver," and I know not how many
more. At last, "Long Branch" and "Elberon;"
then, in a few minutes more, "Ocean
Grove and Asbury Park." At this, a great company
of us began to scurry around and find our
shawl straps, and lunch baskets, and what not.</p>

<p>I'm not going to tell you about Asbury Park;
at least not much. Some other time I may say
a good deal about this pretty city by the sea,
but just now I'm anxious to tell of what happened
at night. The day had been pleasant
enough; not summer, but late spring, bright and
sunshiny; we rejoiced over the thought of getting
sight of the beautiful beach; reminding each
other how lovely the sea looked by moonlight.</p>

<p>Alas, there was no moon for us that night!
At least she did not once show her silver face;
instead, the sky was black with clouds, and the
sea took on its sullen look, and roared as it lashed
the shore constantly with great angry waves.
We shivered and tugged at our wraps as the
wind tried to whirl them away, and said, as we
turned to go home, how glad we were that we
had no friends at sea. "The ocean looks cruel,"
said Grace; "I don't like him to-night."</p>

<p>Then we went home to our bright room;
drew the curtains, closed the shutters, stirred the
fire to a cheery blaze, and chatted and laughed
and were happy, quite shutting out the roar of
the angry sea. But he did not calm; the waves
ran high, and the sullen roar kept increasing,
until, by midnight, we knew it was what seamen
call a gale. Occasionally we heard the fog bell
toll out, and once more we were glad that we
had no dear ones at sea.</p>

<p>Somebody had, though; and while we slept
quietly, knowing nothing of it, brave men were
awake and at work. A danger signal was seen
just off shore; what excitement there was! How
did the men of the life-saving crew know that
they were needed? They had been disbanded for
the summer, the dangerous season being supposed
to be over; and here was blowing one of the
worst storms of the winter! I don't know how
they heard the news. Their hearts waked and
watched, perhaps; anyway, they came, great
stalwart men, and in a twinkling opened their
boathouse, and got out their apparatus which
had been carefully put away, and before the
third signal went up through the stormy water,
were ready for action.</p>

<p>I don't know how they did it. At this time
of which I write, they had no regular lifeboat
such as is now in use; they were not regularly
manned for work in any way. Never mind, they
did it. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
Oh, I do not know how many people rode, some
way, over the stormy water, on a rope, and
reached the shore. Drenched, powerless, almost
breathless, yet alive! Who do you think
was one of the first to arrive that night? Why,
a little baby less than three months old! What!
<i>She</i> did not cling to ropes! Oh, no. All she
did was to lie in utmost quiet in the hands of a
great strong man; he was lashed to the rope in
such a way that the men on shore could pull him
in, but the baby he held in his two strong hands,
as high above the fury of the waves as the hands
would reach. What if he had dropped her?
Then the sea would have swallowed her in an
instant? An awful journey, but the baby did
not know it. She must have gasped a little for
breath, and she may have cried, but no one heard
her; the roaring ocean took care of that.</p>

<p>You don't see how she lived through it?
They did not think she could; not even the
mother, when she took a second to kiss her, before
she gave her into the strong arms, thought
that she should ever see her darling again. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
it was the only possible way of escape; they
could but try. So the baby rode into shore, and
I think as many as a hundred mothers stood
waiting to receive her, with hot blankets enough
to smother her, and warm milk enough to drown
her in; for it had gotten abroad in some way
that a baby was on board the sinking ship. If
you could have heard the shout that went up
when the baby was landed in the arms of one
mother, who said, after a second of solemn hush:
"Yes, she is living!" you would have felt as
though you almost knew what a life was worth.</p>

<p>The next morning what a walk we had along
the coast! How still the sea lay; the waves
crept up softly one after another as if so ashamed
of their last night's work that they would a little
rather not be seen or heard at all. Bits of
board, and old tarred rope, and barrel staves
and seaweed lined the beach for miles, and coffee
sacks by the hundred kept washing in to
shore. The vessel had been laden with coffee.
People were very busy putting the beach in
order, planning how to reach the wreck, wondering
whether she could be gotten off, or would
have to lie half-buried in the sand and slowly
fall to pieces. Here and there were groups of
people, listening, while one man talked excitedly;
he was a sailor and had his wonderful
story to tell of danger and escape. But the
happiest man on the beach that morning was
one who rubbed his hands in actual glee, and
smiling broadly on every one who came up to
him, would say in a loud, glad voice, "Yes, I
lost everything I had in the world, but my wife
and children are all here; yes, baby and all!"
and then he would wipe the great tears from his
eyes, and laugh so loud and glad a laugh that
all the people around would have to join it.</p>

<p>All his children safe! They clustered around
him, several sturdy-looking boys, and I watched
them with eager interest. <i>Were</i> they all safe?
Could the father be sure? The ocean had not
swallowed them, but suppose some awful rum
saloon caught them in its clutches and drew
them in and in until they went down in a storm
of drunkenness to utter ruin! What was an
ocean storm to that? Pitiless ocean, rave as it
might, could not touch the soul; but the rum
saloon has power to destroy both body and soul.
What joy there was over the three-months-old
baby! and yet she may live to be a drunkard's
wife, and a drunkard's mother, and to cry out
in bitterness of soul because the ocean did not
swallow her that night. Isn't it strange and
sad to think of? The father thought his children
safe, and yet so many oceans of temptation
lay ready to engulf them! none more bitter,
more fierce, more wide-spread in its raging, than
this ocean of alcohol. Dear boys and girls, what
can we do to help save the children for their
fathers? Will you all join the life-saving crew,
and work with a will, to rescue victims from
this ocean?</p>

<h2>"FATHER'S OLD BOOTS ARE THERE."</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>MANY a picture of moving pathos appears
in the dark gallery of drunkenness. We
have seen but few more touching ones than this
from the pen of Mrs. M. A. Kidder. She describes
little Benny, the son of a drunken father,
sitting in a room with his mother and little sister.
By looking at this sad and thoughtful face one
would have taken him to be ten years of age, yet
he was but six. No wonder. For four years
this almost baby had been used to seeing a
drunken father go in and out of the cottage.
He scarcely remembers anything from him but
cruelty and abuse. But now he is dead! The
green sod had lain on his grave a week or so, but
the terrible effects of his conduct were not
buried with him. The poor children would start
with a shudder at every uncertain step on the
walk outside, and at every hesitating hand upon
the latch. On the day mentioned Benny's mother
was getting dinner. "Will my little son go to
the wood-shed, and get mother a few sticks to
finish boiling the kettle?"</div>

<p>"I don't like to go to the wood-shed, mamma."</p>

<p>"Why, my son?"</p>

<p>"Because there is a pair of father's old boots
out there, and I don't like to see them."</p>

<p>"Why do you mind the old boots, Benny, any
more than the old coat and hat upstairs?"</p>

<p>"Because," said Benny, tears filling his blue
eyes, "they look as if they wanted to kick me."</p>

<p>Oh the dreadful after-influence of a drunken
father to innocent children! what an awful
memory to bear through life!&mdash;<i>Richmond
Christian Advocate.</i></p>

</div>
<div class="drop-capi">"WHEN morning came," continued
my friend, "how disconsolate
I was! In all my wanderings I had
never had the misfortune to be cast
out and trodden under foot of men
before! The sun was shining beautifully,
the dew was glittering on the blades of
grass, the birds were singing, and the flowers
were blooming sweetly, but I was unhappy.</div>

<div class="caption">THE BOYS' DOGS.</div>
</div>

<p>"Suddenly a little boy and girl turned the
corner, and walked swiftly up towards that part
of the walk where I was. The little girl uttered
an exclamation:</p>

<p>"'Good luck, Fred! I've found a pin!' and
she picked me up and put me in her belt. They
walked along, talking merrily, when a butterfly
flew along the walk. The little boy ran after it,
and soon had it under his hat. 'Let me have
that pin, Bess,' he said, and when she had given
me to him he pinned his handkerchief over the
hat, with me and another pin that he had, and
walked home bareheaded.</p>

<p>"Reaching their house, he went up to his
room, threw the other poor pin out of the window,
and, much to my dismay, impaled the butterfly
on me. How horrid I felt! I would have
shuddered if I could, for how cruel was the boy
to make me the innocent instrument of the
death of a poor winged insect, that had been so
bright and happy but a few moments before!</p>

<p>"But just then his sister came along, and
seeing the butterfly fluttering on me, gradually
losing its strength, she uttered an exclamation
of horror, and let the poor thing
go, placing me where she had before. Her
brother Fred came in.</p>

<p>"'Now, Bess, that's mean! What possessed
you to let my butterfly go?'</p>

<p>"'Because it was so cruel, Fred dear.
I couldn't bear to see it struggling so!' and a
tear came into her eye.</p>

<p>"Her brother muttered something about
girls' tender feelings.</p>

<p>"That day as Bessie and her mother were
sitting sewing on the piazza of their house,
her mother wanted a pin, and so she speedily
delivered me into the lady's hands. She used
me for some sewing a little while, and then
put me on a little pincushion in her work-box,
where I remained for about a week.</p>

<p>"Then there was a commotion in the
house. I learned from various talks that
Fred with a good many other boys, was going
camping into the woods, and they were
busy getting ready for his departure. He
was off at last. He had a gun, a satchel full
of clothing, and an umbrella. Just as he
was going out of the door, and his mother was
kissing him good-by, she said:</p>

<p>"'Fred, wait a moment. I didn't give you
any pins, and you may need some.'</p>

<p>"So saying, she took me and a few others
from the cushion in her work-box, and putting
them hastily on Fred's coat, bade him good-by
again, and he started.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell you all the fun that the boys
had in the woods; they seemed perfectly happy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and fished, and shot poor animals, and climbed,
all the time. Wherever Fred went, I went too.</p>

<p>"At night they would go into the tents, and
lie down, sleeping soundly all night, and getting
up early in the morning, to eat what they
had caught latest the day before. All night I
kept watch over Fred's pillow, in his coat that
was hanging on a nail driven into one of the
tent-poles.</p>

<p>"One day one of the dogs came to the place
where the boys were taking dinner, sniffing
around their legs, and showing as plainly as possible
that he had discovered something. The
boys hastily finished their dinner, and followed
the noble animal into the woods. Soon the dog
stopped, and looking ahead, they saw, by a pool,
a splendid deer drinking, little suspecting what
danger there was near.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 211px;">
<img src="images/illus49.jpg" width="211" height="600" alt="butterfly in branches" />
<div class="caption">A BUTTERFLY FLEW ALONG.</div>
</div>
<p>"'Fire!' said the boys' leader; and a dozen
shots went crashing into the poor deer's side.
It fell down dying. One of the boys went over
to examine it. When he reached it, it gave one
faint struggle, and expired. But a boy that had
remained thought it was yet alive, and fired another
shot, taking care not to aim at the one who
had gone forward. But he was just bending
over to examine the horns of the animal, and the
shot went crashing into his leg! Then there
was an uproar! The boys all rushed forward,
my master among them, and examined the poor
boy's leg, which was bleeding very badly.</p>

<p>"'Where is a bandage?' said some one. So the
leader took out of his pocket a very large handkerchief,
and wound it tightly just above the wound.
The blood stopped flowing. 'Where is a string
to tie it with?' he said. No one had one, but
Fred put his hand to his coat, and taking me
from it, said, 'Here is a pin, Tom. Pin it
quick!'</p>

<p>"So the handkerchief was pinned tightly
around the leg, and the blood didn't ooze out
any more. However, the wound pained the
poor boy very much. The others fixed him
pretty comfortably on the soft body of the deer,
while two of them went for a doctor as fast as
possible.</p>

<p>"It was two hours before he came.</p>

<p>"'Not very serious,' he said, at which every
body drew a long breath of relief. 'But it
would have been,' he continued, 'if you hadn't
pinned this bandage on so securely. He would
certainly have bled to death.'</p>


<p>"You may imagine that I felt proud then. I
had saved a life! If it had not been for me the
boy would have died! To be sure, another pin
would have done, but then it was&mdash;<i>me!</i> I felt
that I was doing wrong to be so proud, and like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
everyone who sins, I got my punishment. When
the doctor undid the bandage, he carelessly
threw me on the ground, and paid no more attention
to me, for when he replaced a better
bandage on the limb, he used a wide strip of
cloth to fasten it with.</p>

<p>"You can not imagine my feelings then!
There I was, cast on the ground in the woods,
where nobody would ever find me. I would
rust, and fall to pieces! I would never be moved
from that lonesome, dreary place. And it was
my fault! I felt that it was my punishment for
feeling so proud. To be sure, the doctor did not
know that I was proud when he threw me on
ground, but I felt 'in my bones,' as it were, that
it was my punishment for feeling so lofty because
I had been the humble means of saving a
life. The agony of those few moments will be
a lesson to me through life, and if I ever feel
lofty and haughty again, I shall be surprised.</p>

<p>"I say 'those few moments,' for soon, some of
the boys came to remove the body of the deer,
and Fred, who was among them, happening to
see me on the ground said:</p>

<p>"'Halloo! I guess I'll pick you up. I've
learned how useful a pin may be.'</p>

<p>"So my stay on the ground in the woods was
not long, for he returned me to the lining of his
coat."</p>

<h2>SOME REMARKABLE WOMEN.</h2>

<h3>L.&mdash;LYON, MARY.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-f2.jpg" width="74" height="92" alt="F" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">FROM 1797 until 1849, a period of fifty-two
years, Mary Lyon lived upon this
earth. Some lives seem too short. To
us they appear to be broken off at the wrong
place&mdash;in the midst of earnest successful work&mdash;and
we wonder how the world can get along without
them. And so I suppose it must have seemed
to those interested in the grand work of education
in which Mary Lyon was engaged when
she at the command of the Master laid down
the burden and slept the last sleep. For thirty-five
years she had been using her talents and her
energies in training up young girls for noble
womanhood. Like others in our list of Remarkable
Women, her early home was among the
New England hills. As another has expressed it,
"On the little mountain farm the child saw the
flax grow to make her single summer dress,
and herself petted and fed the lambs and sheep
which gave the wool to keep her warm in winter.
The fairy flax flowers, blue as heaven, delighted
her eyes." And we may believe that later she
watched the process of preparing the flax for
the wheel and loom, and we are told that the
little girl in her homespun dress which made her
no oddity in the old-time country school, was
earnest and diligent in her studies, standing at
the head of her classes and steadily advancing in
scholarship. Mary Lyon early realized that life
was not meant for a play-day, and when at the
age of seventeen she became a teacher, she took
with her into the schoolroom a strong faith and
earnest endeavor for the highest development
of her pupils. She sought more than mental
progress&mdash;even moral and spiritual growth.
Though she taught, leaving her impress for good
in other places, Mt. Holyoke Seminary, at South
Hadley, stands as her monument. The founding
of this school was her great work, and in thousands
of homes her influence is still felt. Many of
our mothers and grandmothers are living lives of
usefulness, the inspiration of which was drawn
from lessons learned of this most remarkable of
teachers. Mary Lyon was one of the great teachers
of this world. If there should be among the
girls who read this article those who expect to become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
teachers, let me urge you to study the life
of Mary Lyon. See if you can find out the secret
of her success; go over the record of her struggle
with the difficulties encountered in those
days when Mt. Holyoke Seminary was getting a
foothold. One has said that "the story of Mary
Lyon and her work should be read by every
young girl who desires to know the meaning of
a noble and consecrated life." I think you will
find the secret of her successful life lies in the
fact of its being a consecrated life; consecrated
to the high and noble purpose for which she
labored. Believing "that Christian women inspired
with Christian zeal would be powerful promoters
of the kingdom of Christ in this world,"
she sought to perfect a plan whereby young girls
might be brought under the influences which
would tend to inspire their hearts, awaken their
powers, and prepare them for the positions of influence
which they might be called to occupy.
With a sublime faith in the leadership of Christ,
a belief that she was called to do this thing, she
fought out the battle, accomplished her mission
and left behind her in many hearts a spirit akin
to her own. Out from the sweet, sacred influences
of this first collegiate school for girls
established in this country, have gone thousands
of noble women. Some have gone to carry the
word of life into the dark places of earth, showing
the beauty of a Christian home as contrasted
with the heathen homes; some have gone out
to establish other schools of like character; and
on mission fields, in homes everywhere and in
schools and in society, the spirit which so long
ago found expression in that consecrated life is
still influencing the world for good.</div>

"Papa came back and took us away,<br />

</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">BETSEY, the farmer's wife, put up a lunch
large enough to last a couple of voyagers
for a two days' journey, and bustled
around in her quickest style, so that she
ran out to the barn with her big basket
as Farmer Bassett drew a long breath and declared
himself ready to start.</div>

<p>"Do hurry, John," she begged, setting her
basket within the sleigh, "those poor creeters
must be half-starved, let alone their crying theirselves
eenamost to death."</p>

<p>Then her motherly heart that had taken up
entirely the cause of the boys, allowed throbs of
pity to be felt on Thomas' account as she saw
the effect of her words upon him, and she
hastened to add&mdash;"You'll make pretty quick
time after you git on the road, and boys always
know how to have a good time as long as daylight
lasts, at any rate."</p>

<p>"You better believe, Betsey," declared Farmer
Bassett, "that we will not let the grass, or
the snow rather, accumulate under our feet, will
we, Jack?" caressing his horse. "There, Mr. &mdash;&mdash; what'd
you say your name was?" turning
to the man beside him.</p>

<p>"Thomas, sir&mdash;Thomas Bradley. But I'm
better known as Mr. Bangs' man, bad luck to
the day I shirked a bit. But I'll catch it enough
when I get home, though"&mdash;</p>

<p>"And serves you quite right, Thomas," observed
Farmer Bassett; "well, get in, and we'll
be off. Good-by, mother!" He didn't kiss her;
it was not the New England way in which they
had both been reared, but he did look at her
round, comely face with such an expression in
his gray eyes that a smile went back to him
from the lips firmly folded together&mdash;"Take
care of yourself now, an' the house, I'll be along
in the mornin'."</p>

<p>Then he got into the sleigh, and tucking up the
well-worn robes around his companion and himself,
signified to Jack by a loud "<i>g'lang!</i>" that
he was expected to start.</p>

<p>"I s'pose you're going to talk to me now,"
said Thomas awkwardly, after they had turned
the corner from which the last view of the comfortable
red farmhouse could be seen, "and give
me a piece of your mind for leaving them chaps
and disobeying master. You've a good right,
I'm sure, being as you're getting me out o' the
scrape."</p>

<p>"I ain't one to do preachin' to other folks,"
said the farmer shortly. "I have enough to do
to take care o' my own sins."</p>

<p>Thomas stared in amazement into the tough,
leathery face. That any one who could claim the
least right, should let slip to "give it to" another
man caught in a peccadillo, he could not
understand, and he took the only way to find
relief that came to his mind. When he finished
scratching his head in a perplexed way, he relapsed
into silence that was not broken till at
least half the distance to Sachem Hill was traversed.</p>

<p>Then the old farmer began to converse, but
on general topics, and in such a cheery way,
that his travelling companion came a bit out of
his shamefaced despondency feeling as if there
might be a chance even for him in the world
once more.</p>

<p>By the time that Jack jingled them into the
vicinity of Mr. Bangs' summer cottage, the two
were in such a good state of mind that any one
meeting them would have said it was only a
pleasure excursion that drew them out to enjoy
the night.</p>

<p>And now Thomas sat erect and drew his
breath fast, while his eyes, strained to their utmost,
pierced the gathering darkness for the first
glimpse of the house.</p>

<p>"Turn here up this lane, master," he begged
suddenly, "it's a short cut," and the old farmer
lashed Jack, all the time begging the astonished
animal's pardon, while he hurried up the back
way as directed.</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;oh!" groaned Thomas, pulling his
arm, and pointing with a shaking hand. Farmer
Bassett more intent on the feelings of the faithful
horse, and on getting on, had not glanced
up. At this cry of distress he did, and now
saw with Thomas a bright light gleaming from
one of the upper windows of the Bangs' cottage.</p>

<p>"It's <small>FIRE</small>!" said Thomas hoarsely, plucking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
him by the arm again. "We must 'a' left somethin'
smoulderin' in the fire-place"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said the farmer reassuringly.
Nevertheless he gave Jack another cut that
made him jounce at a fearful rate up to the
back veranda.</p>

<p>Thomas leaped out and sped up the steps.
Farmer Bassett tarried only long enough to
fasten Jack to the hitching-post, throw his
blanket over him, and give one pat on his head,
then followed.</p>

<p>"<i>Boys!</i>" screamed Thomas, racing up and
down the veranda, and shaking the doors, "are
you in there?"</p>

<p>But only the branches of the trees creaked in
the cold wind for answer. Thomas stamped in
very fury.</p>

<p>"See here," said the old farmer, down on the
ground and pointing up, "look at their heads.
They're all safe an' sound, an' not half as cold
as you an' I."</p>

<p>With that he sent out such a halloo that
Thomas on the veranda clapped his hands to his
ears. It had the effect desired, for at least two
of the windows in the gable end of the cottage
were thrown up, and as many boys' heads as
could possibly be accommodated, were thrust
out.</p>

<p>"Halloo, Thomas, halloo," called one voice
in derision, "don't you wish you were here
too?"</p>

<p>"You're a nice one," said Master Wingate,
"and won't you catch it, though, when you get
home. You'll be place-hunting as soon as you
can say 'Jack Robinson'"&mdash;</p>

<p>"See here, you young scamp," shouted the
old farmer, "it will be for your interest to end
that sort of talk, now I tell you. You just step
down lively an' open one of these doors. We've
cooled our heels enough comin' to look for you
an' don't propose to stand here any longer.
Hurry up, now."</p>

<p>The boys stared in astonishment down into as
much of his face as the darkness would permit
them to see, and recognizing from the quality
of his voice that a parley would not be acceptable,
drew in their heads and proceeded to obey
the order.</p>

<p>"Who is the old party?" cried one of the
boys as they ran over the stairs.</p>

<p>"I don't know," returned Wingate, "I'm
sure."</p>

<p>"Don't let us open the door then," urged
another boy; "see here, Wingate," laying a detaining
hand on his arm, "you are not obliged
to&mdash;nobody has a right to order you to unlock
your father's house. Don't do it; we'll
lose all the fun of keeping Thomas out till
we've had the fun of scaring him all we want
to."</p>

<p>Master Wingate hesitated. But a vigorous
rap on the dining-room door at the foot of the
staircase, made him start, and a loud imperative&mdash;"Hurry
up, there," caused him to redouble
his speed.</p>

<p>"I guess we better let 'em in," he said, and
slid back the bolt.</p>

<h2>THE DESERT MIRAGE.</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>I SUPPOSE you all have heard of the mirage,
which is a delusion of the eye, and which
often deceives the poor traveller across the
weary, pathless desert. Sometimes, when the
caravan is about to give up, and lie down to die
of weariness and thirst, they will suddenly feel
their courage revived by the sight, as they suppose,
of a lovely oasis, with lofty palms and
silvery fountains.</div>

<p>Not long since I was reading an account of a
whole regiment who when the Egyptians first
conquered Nubia were destroyed. The poor
creatures saw this mirage, and ordered their
guide to take them thither. He insisted that
it was only the delusive mirage, and, in their
anger, they fell upon and killed him. The regiment
then rushed for the supposed lake. Faint
and weary they hurried over the hot sands. Oh!
how those sparkling silvery waters allured them
on!</p>

<p>But soon the cooling lake turned into sand!
And the whole regiment lay down on the burning
sands, and when found by Arabs, sent to
search for them, they were all dead.</p>

<p>Now, dear little friends, there are some so-called
pleasures in life which allure us like the
mirage&mdash;but let us not be deceived. Let us
choose the better part, which can never be taken
from us.</p>                                     <div class='sig'>J.</div>

<h2>AGNES HEDENSTROM.</h2>

</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">THIS is something as Miss Agnes Hedenstrom
looked when she was eight
years old, and living among her wealthy
relatives in Upsala. She was an orphan,
petted by everybody and allowed to
have her own way.</div>

<p>Thus she grew up, apparently a spoiled child.</p>

<p>She was not happy, however, though indulged
with whatever she wished. She felt the need
of something else.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 322px;">
<img src="images/illus60.jpg" width="322" height="402" alt="Girl playing a lute" />
<div class="caption">WHEN SHE WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD.</div>
</div>

<p>One day she heard a Swedish minister preach,
and soon after Agnes gave her heart to Jesus.
Strangely enough, she began herself to preach to
her people, now in schoolhouses, now in great
halls.</p>

<p>Often she would address on the streets of
London great crowds of the worst sort of people.</p>

<p>For years she thus toiled on among the
wretched and wicked and dangerous people who
infested East London.</p>

<p>Once she was speaking alone in an awful place
to twenty drunken sailors while they yelled and
blasphemed. Still she continued as best she
could to tell them the wondrous story of redeeming
love. Think of the "spoiled Agnes"
coming to be such a brave, true woman! She
still shudders to remember those awful moments
when she did not know but those wretches
would tear her to pieces. They did not. They
became quiet and subdued. The next evening
they came, bringing some of their comrades
with them.</p>

<p>Then came a lecture room by her
efforts; then a larger one. A few years
ago Miss Agnes went among the good
people of London and told them about
the wretched people among whom she
was laboring, especially the wicked sailors.</p>

<p>They gave her money to build a Home
for sailors, when they come on shore
without friends and an army of saloons
to tempt them to drink and waste all their
earnings in "riotous living."</p>

<p>Well, after waiting some months for
the builders to finish the work, she clapped
her hands&mdash;not on her guitar as when she
was a child&mdash;but <i>together</i> as she walked
through this Home.</p>

<p>She is sole manager of the sailors'
boarding-house. There she sees that the
beds are clean and the meals good. She
has books and papers, and best of all, her
dear Master Jesus in this Home.</p>

<p>More than a thousand sailors are thought
to have been saved from their awfully
wicked ways through this wonderful
Agnes Hedenstrom.</p>

<p>Some one has said that God can thresh
a mountain with a worm. Would not you like
to be the worm in his hand?</p>

<h2>OUR ALPHABET OF GREAT MEN.</h2>

<h3>O.&mdash;OBOOKIAH, HENRY.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-a2.jpg" width="72" height="114" alt="A" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">A FEW years ago I copied from a marble
slab, imbedded in the earth upon a
grave in a quiet country cemetery at
Cornwall, Ct., the following inscription:</div>

<div class='center'>
<span class="smcap">Henry Obookiah of Owhyee,<br />
Died February 17, 1818, aged 26.</span><br />
</div>

<p>His arrival in this country gave rise to the
Foreign Mission School of which he was a worthy
member. He was once an idolator and designed
for a Pagan priest; but by the grace of God, and
by the prayers and instructions of pious friends,
he became a Christian. He was eminent for
piety and missionary zeal; was almost prepared
to return to his native island to preach the Gospel
when God called him. In his last moments
he wept and prayed for his "Ow-hy-hee," but
was submissive to the will of God and died without
fear, with a heavenly smile on his face and
glory in his soul.</p>

<p>This remarkable young man was early made
an orphan by the cruel massacre of both father
and mother during a fearful struggle of two
parties for the control of his native island,
Hawaii. His younger brother was also slain while
the boy of our sketch was endeavoring to save
him by carrying him upon his back in his flight.
Obookiah was taken prisoner and made a member
of the family of the man who had murdered
his parents. After a year or two he was discovered
by an uncle, and his release from the
hands of his enemy secured. His uncle was a
priest and he entered upon the work of preparing
his young nephew for the same service.
This preparation was very different from the
preparation of young men in Christian lands for
the work of the Gospel ministry. One part of
his duty was to learn and to repeat long prayers;
sometimes he was forced to spend the greater
part of the night in repeating these prayers in
the temple before the idols. But Henry was
not happy; he had seen his parents and little
brother cruelly murdered, and thoughts of the
terrible scene and of his own lonely and orphaned
condition preyed upon his mind continually.
But he had passed through still another sad experience.
Before peace was restored in the
island he was again taken prisoner together with
his father's sister. He succeeded in making his
escape the very day which had been appointed
for his death. His aunt was killed by the enemy,
and this made him feel more sad and lonely than
before, and he resolved to leave the island, hoping
that if he should succeed in getting away
from the place where everything reminded him
of his loss he might find peace if not happiness;
and this is how he was to be brought under
Christian influences in Christian America. He
sailed with Captain Britnall and landed in New
York in the year 1809. He remained for some
time in the family of his friend the captain, at
New Haven. And here he became acquainted
with several of the students in Yale College, who
were at once interested in this young foreigner,
and from one of these friends he learned to read
and write.</p>

<p>His appearance was not prepossessing or
promising. His clothes were those of a rough
sailor and his countenance dull and expressionless.
But he soon showed that he was neither
dull nor lacking in mental power.</p>

<p>For some time, while Obookiah improved in
the knowledge of English, making good progress
in his studies, he was unwilling to hear any talk
about the true God. He was amiable and quite
willing to be taught, and drank in eagerly the instruction
given on other subjects, but after some
months he began to pray to the true God. He
had a friend, also a Hawaiian and his first prayer
in the presence of another was made in company
with his friend. A copy of this prayer has been
preserved and I copy it for you to show how even
in the beginning of his own interest in Gospel
truth, his thoughts turned towards his native
country.</p>

<p>"Great and eternal God&mdash;make heaven&mdash;make
earth&mdash;make everything&mdash;have mercy on
me&mdash;make me understand the Bible&mdash;make me
good&mdash;great God, have mercy on Thomas&mdash;make
him good&mdash;make Thomas and me go back
to Hawaii&mdash;tell folks in Hawaii no more pray
to stone god&mdash;make some good man go with me
to Hawaii, tell folks in Hawaii about heaven"&mdash;</p>

<p>From this time until he died his one longing
was to go back to his early home and tell the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
people about God. He used to talk with his
friend Thomas about it and plan the work. In
his diary he wrote at one time:</p>

<p>"We conversed about what we would do first
at our return, how we should begin to teach our
poor brethren about the religion of Jesus Christ.
We thought we must first go to the king or else
we must keep a school and educate the children
and get them to have some knowledge of the
Scriptures and give them some idea of God.
The most thought that come into my mind was
to leave all in the hand of Almighty God; as he
seeth fit. The means may be easily done by us,
but to make others believe, no one could do it
but God only."</p>

<p>In April, 1817, a Foreign Mission School was
opened at Cornwall. And Obookiah became a
pupil in this school, intending to finish his preparation
for work among his own people as soon
as practicable. A description of this Sandwich
Islander as given of him at that time may be of
interest: "He was a little less than six feet in
height, well-proportioned, erect, graceful and
dignified. His countenance had lost every trace
of dullness, and was in an unusual degree
sprightly and intelligent. His features were
strongly marked, expressive of a sound and penetrating
mind; he had a piercing eye, a prominent
Roman nose, and a chin considerably
projected. His complexion was olive, differing
equally from the blackness of the African and
the redness of the Indian. His black hair was
dressed after the manner of Americans."</p>

<p>As a scholar he was persevering and thorough.
After he had gained some knowledge of English,
he conceived the idea of reducing his native
language to writing. As it was merely a spoken
language, everything was to be done. He had
succeeded in translating the Book of Genesis and
made some progress in the work of making a
grammar and dictionary. But the work he had
planned was not to be finished by his own hand.
Within a year from the time he entered the
school at Cornwall he was called home. As recorded
upon the marble slab, his last thoughts
were for his native island; his last earthly longing
was, that the Gospel might be preached to
his own countrymen. One of our popular cyclopædias
gives a brief mention of this remarkable
young man and makes this statement: "He was
the cause of the establishment of American
Missions in the Sandwich Islands."</p>

<p>To have so lived, and by his earnestness and
zeal so inspired others that upon his death they
were ready to take up and carry forward the
work he had planned, was to have accomplished
even more than he could had he been permitted
to enter upon the work for which he was preparing.</p>

A HOLE in the pocket's a very bad thing,<br />

Than anything under the sun, I think.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My mother, she calls it disaster.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">For all in one day,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">I lost, I may say,</span><br />
Through a hole not as big as a dollar,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">A number of things,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Including some rings</span><br />
From a chain Fido wore as a collar,<br />
<br />
My knife, a steel pen, a nice little note<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That my dear cousin Annie had sent me.</span><br />
The boy who found that, pinned it on to his hat,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And tries all the time to torment me.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">I'd lost a new dime</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">That very same time,</span><br />
But it lodged in the heel of my stocking;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And one thing beside,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Which to you I confide,</span><br />
Though I fear you may think it quite shocking:<br />
<br />
The doctor had made some nice little pills<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For me to take home to the baby;</span><br />
But, when I reached there, I was quite in despair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They had slipped through my pocket, it may be.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Aunt Sallie, she,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">As cool as can be,</span><br />
Said, a hole in a boy's reputation,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Is harder to cure,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And worse to endure,</span><br />
Than all pockets unsound in the nation.<br />
<br />
Still a hole in the pocket's a very bad thing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I am sure a real cause of disaster.</span><br />
But baby is well; so you must never tell;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Perhaps he got well all the faster.</span><br />

very deeply somebody will say, "Oh! don't light
the lamp just yet, it is so much pleasanter to sit in
the twilight," and then it won't seem but about
ten minutes, and the children and young folks will
be whisked off to bed, and the games will be
crowded entirely off the programme, and the
Family will feel as if it had no good-night frolic
at all. So we must get all the fun we can, and

<h3>A BUBBLE PARTY.</h3>

<p>Choose all your players if you can beforehand,
so as to have each one select his and her color.
As far as possible, wear as much of that color,
<i>putting away all other colors</i>, on dress, in button-hole
of coat, or scarf around in Highland fashion
on the boys' coats, and be sure to tie a bright
bow of ribbon of same color on stem of pipe. A
player can decorate himself or herself in any
way he or she chooses. Variety makes the
game all the more brilliant. A cap trimmed
with one's color is always pretty for the girls,
and toques or soldier caps for the boys.</p>

<p>Dissolve a quarter of an ounce of Castile or
oil soap cut up in small pieces, in three quarters
of a pint of water, and boil for two or three
minutes; then add five ounces of glycerine.
When cold, this fluid will produce the best and
most lasting bubbles that can be blown.</p>

<p>Now make your soap-bubbles in a big bowl,
and choose your sides, an equal number on each,
and range them opposite each other, and begin.
The side that can make and keep unbroken the

<h2>THE CHURCH ROBINS.</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>ONE pleasant April Sabbath, the parish clerk
of a church in Wiltshire, England, stood
at his reading-desk turning to the morning "lesson"
in the great Prayer-Book. The congregation
waited to give the responses, but he did not
begin as soon as usual. Something curious had
caught his eye, partly hidden under the Bible-rack,
a small, slanting ledge or platform, slightly
raised above the main desk. He looked more
closely, and there, directly beneath the great
Bible, he saw a robin-redbreast's nest, with two
pretty blue eggs in it. Mrs. Redbreast and her
mate had found a hole left by a small missing
pane in one of the quaint old leaden windows,
and entered the sacred house to make their little
home where the sparrow and the swallow did
that the sons of Korah sing of in the eighty-fourth
Psalm. The clerk could not resent so
pretty an intrusion, and did not disturb the nest;
and when one of the birds flew in before the
close of service, neither he nor any one of the
congregation thought of doing anything to
frighten it. And there the nest remained
through the rest of April and nearly the whole
of May, the redbreasts becoming so tame that
the gathering of the worshippers and the voices
and music of the service on Sundays or other
days did not alarm them away. The sitting bird
would stay, quietly brooding her eggs, while the
clerk was reading, almost directly over her head.
After the young were hatched, the male robin
would fly in with worms in his bill to feed them,
and his coming never disturbed the people's
litany or the rector's sermon. This pleasant
sanctuary partnership lasted till the full-fledged
young were able to leave the church and trust
to their own wings. Everybody felt that the
birds had brought a blessing with them, and
were sorry when they went away.&mdash;<i>Selected.</i></div>

<div class='poem'>
<span class='smcap'>Merry</span> Jack Frost and his fairy elves<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Came by for a raid one night</span><br />
When the spring was young, and a rosebud fair,<br />
In a sheltered nook, which the perfumed air<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the sunbeams, warm and bright,</span><br />
Had wooed for a month, 'till its dainty brow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was bright as the flush of dawn,</span><br />
Shone fair 'neath the moon; "'Tis a goodly sight!<br />
I'll cover it o'er with a veil of white,"<br />
Quoth Jack; "ha! ha! and the morning light<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will shine on its glory, gone!"</span><br />
He gathered his elves for the mischievous prank,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When lo! with a mournful sigh,</span><br />
The south wind called to a pitying cloud,<br />
"O look! they're weaving the rosebud's shroud."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She paused in the midnight sky,</span><br />
And glanced at the rose. "Is her doom so near?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Poor bud!" and his tears fell fast.</span><br />
Oh! the elves were caught in a mournful plight,<br />
And the south wind laughed, and the frost-king's flight<br />
Was a sight to see through the dusk of night,<br />
For the cloud's soft tears overwhelmed him quite<br />
As they fell on his vestments fine and white;<br />
And the lovely Dawn, with her shafts of light,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Looked down on <i>his glory, past!</i></span><br />

<div class='drop-cap'>MY Blossoms all, I wish you a sunshiny
April. I know she is apt to shed many
tears, but for that very reason we must try to
keep our faces unusually bright, for contrast.</div>

<p>I have given you this month several letters
from our Blossoms. This, in the future, will be
a special feature for our P. S. Corner. I have been
selfish in keeping all the sweet bright little letters
to myself. There is room for only a very few
out of the hundreds which come each month, but
you may take them as specimens of the rest. I
wish we had room to print them all, for your
enjoyment. Meantime, send them on for me to
read, that I may keep posted as to what you are
doing, and discover in what ways I can best
help you.</p>

<div class='sig'>
Lovingly,      &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Pansy</span>.<br />
</div>

<hr class="short" />

<p><i>Mary Louise</i> from Florida. How glad it makes
me to hear that the Whisper Motto helps you! It
is sure to help every one who is faithful to it.
That is a sweet thought of yours, to lend your
<span class="smcap">Pansies</span> to others. I wonder how many of our
Blossoms think to do a little good in that way?
It would be so easy, and might help somebody
very much. Do you like the "land of flowers?"
I spent a month there last winter, and had a
very happy time. I go to de Funiak Springs,
where the Sabbath-school Assembly holds its
meetings. Perhaps you will go, and I shall
meet you there. Would not that be pleasant?
If you do, you must surely come to me and say:
"I am Mary Louise," then I shall know you at
once.</p>

<p><i>Lizzie</i> from Connecticut. My dear, I pray for
every name enrolled on our P. S. book. That
God will make each Blossom fragrant for him,
and take it some day to his heavenly garden, is
my constant hope and prayer. Perhaps you
need to use the prayer which I find very necessary
for me every day: "Set a watch, O Lord,
before my tongue. Keep the door of my lips."</p>

<p><i>Emma</i> from Massachusetts. My dear, <span class="smcap">The
Pansy</span> is just twelve years old. Doesn't it
travel over a large part of the world for one so
young?</p>

<p><i>Lena</i> from Massachusetts. We should be
glad to hear about the entertainment. I hope
you had a good time. Suppose you see how
good a description you can write of it, and of
your Sabbath-school?</p>

<p><i>Annie</i> from Georgia. But I do not know that
you are in Georgia now, my Blossom. Perhaps
you have already moved to that "New home."
If so, you will be able to write and tell me how
you like it. I was glad to get your full name
for enrollment.</p>

<p><i>Emma</i> from Illinois. What success do you
have with "impatience?" He is a very trying
enemy; you certainly do well to rid yourself of
him. But did you find it easy work? A little
friend of mine said she could be just as patient
as anybody when things went as she wanted
them to; it was when nothing behaved right
that she got impatient. I have known older
people than she who might have said the same.</p>

<p><i>Alice</i> from Vermont. My dear Blossom, I
hope the badge reached you in safety and is
helping you about taking care of those "things."
Such little habits are great trials to "mamma,"
and I am sure our little Alice wants to be all the
comfort she can to mother, especially now that
God has taken the dear father and the sister
home. I know how lonely you must be without
them; but I hope you are trying every day
to live so that when He calls you, it will be a
joy for you to go and join your dear ones in
their bright home.</p>

<p><i>Andrew</i> from Dakota. Here comes another
"impatient" boy! So they cannot be patient
out in Dakota any better than they can farther
East? Well, Satan seems to be busy bothering
people all the world over. The Whisper Motto
is just these three words: "For Jesus' Sake."
We call it the Whisper Motto, not because we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
want to hide it, but because we want to have it
about with us all the time, speaking softly to
our hearts when others cannot hear, perhaps
when others are in the midst of talk which makes
us feel cross, and we want to remember to give
a "soft" answer because that is the only one
which will please Jesus. There is no "charge"
for membership in the P. S. There is a pledge
to try to overcome some bad habit, and to adopt
the Whisper Motto as one's own. We welcome
you to our ranks, and have enrolled your name.</p>

<p><i>Helen</i> from New Jersey. Oh, yes; we will
try as hard as we can to help you. Whenever
you see the meek little blossom on your badge,
I hope it will put this verse into your mind:
"For even Christ pleased not himself." If you
think of this and try every time to do the thing
you did not want to, so your life will be pleasing
to Jesus, by and by it will grow so pleasant to
you to think of what others want, that you will
forget it was ever a trouble. I am glad you are
going to try it.</p>

<p><i>Lanetta</i> from New Hampshire. Not at all
too late for good wishes, my friend; nine months
of the year left to improve. Shall you and I
try hard to make it the happiest year of our
lives? What a quiet, pleasant Christmas you
told me of! It rests me to think of your happy
home.</p>

<p><i>Mildred</i> from New York. Yes, I know, the
little baby brother needs a great deal of patience.
Sometimes it helps us to sit down in a
corner by ourselves, and try to imagine how
desolate the house would be without him. I
know of a woman who sometimes sheds bitter
tears, even now, because the last words she
spoke to her little baby brother more than fifty
years ago, were cross ones! Glad to receive
your pledge.</p>

<p>Here is a lovely bouquet of Blossoms from
Massachusetts: <i>Cora</i>, <i>Ida</i>, <i>Bessie</i>, <i>Lizzie</i>,
<i>Louise</i>, <i>Margaret</i>. Just a sweet half-dozen. I
hardly know a bouquet of which I think with so
much pleasure as this one. Something whispers
to me that some of them are trying hard to help
the others. Perhaps all are trying. Like the
rest of us, these Blossoms have work to do;
weeds will grow in flower gardens, if not carefully
watched. Here is the weed of "Carelessness"
popping up its naughty head to trouble
Louise; it is so much easier to leave the books
or the playthings just where they happen to
drop; at least it seems easier at the time. Try
the other way, Louise, and see how much comfort
you will get from it.</p>

<p>Margaret's sweet little tongue wants to speak,
sometimes, when it would better keep silence; so
many tongues attempt that! Margaret is going
to teach hers that while "Speech is silver, silence
is golden."</p>

<p>Cora's tongue, too, is sometimes tempted to
speak naughty words; watch it, my child. Do
you know the verse&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
This one little tongue that God has given<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Must always speak for him.</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>If we make our words always such as He will
love to hear, we shall be safe.</div>

<p>Ida's tongue is tempted to whisper when it
should be silent. Isn't it astonishing how many
wrong things there are for tongues to do, and
how sure they are to go wrong if they can!
Ida, as well as the rest of us, needs this prayer:
"Keep the door of my lips, that I sin not with
my tongue."</p>

<p>Bessie is evidently tempted to move slowly,
either with hands or feet, or both, when she
should make all speed. I am glad indeed to hear
that you are going to try to teach these members
better.</p>

<p>And here is little Lizzie, the last of the group,
who has a hard task indeed before her; she is
going to try not to "do anything wrong."
That sounds like a very large pledge; but after
all, if we are soldiers of Jesus, it is no more than
he asks: "Whether therefore ye eat or drink,
or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God."</p>

<p>Dear Blossoms, I hope I shall hear often from
you, that you are growing, and blooming, and
spreading your fragrance for Jesus' sake.</p>

<p><i>George</i> from Illinois. Welcome, my boy, to
our roll. I am an excellent hand to read writing;
just try me and see if I don't make yours
out, without any trouble. Meantime, we, you
and I, are very grateful to mamma for writing
for you, and for all the kind words she speaks.</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> from Washington. Your threefold
pledge is very important; especially that one
about "reading the Bible every day." If all the
young people of this generation, or even if all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
those who belong to the P. S., would make and
keep that resolution through life, I am certain
we should have a different world to live in, by
the time they were old enough to help manage it.
Dear me! What am I talking about? Not one
of you but is old enough this minute to help
manage the world, your little piece of it, and I
haven't the least doubt but that you are doing
it; the question is, How?</p>

<p><i>Ollie</i> from Texas. Your first letter! Good!
How glad I am you wrote the first one to
me. But really I don't understand about the
"squirrel." Didn't you find him on some other
page? Think it up, my boy, and let us know.
Meantime, I have enjoyed your letter.</p>

<p><i>Walter</i> from Dakota. I acknowledge that it
is very sad to think of one of my Blossoms as
being "mad." But since it is only when you
"get out of patience," and you have taken a
pledge to keep yourself supplied with that article,
we shall hope to hear better things of you
very soon. We gladly welcome you.</p>

<p><i>Netta</i> from Missouri. What a busy little
woman you must be in school! Your studies
are all important, and I hope I may think of you
as one of the most faithful scholars in the room.
Can I?</p>

<p><i>George</i> from Illinois. I am sorry, my dear
friend, that I have not a photograph for you.
I have often thought what a pleasant thing it
would be if I could afford to send a photograph
of myself as a birthday gift to each of my
Pansies! But alas, alas! my pocket book will
not let me. No! I remember you did not ask
me to give it; you were very polite. I will
answer your question, however, as to where you
can find it. L. E. Walker of Warsaw, New
York, is authorized to furnish a good picture
of me, and will reply promptly to your question
as to price. I have forgotten what they cost;
they are cabinet size. D. Lothrop &amp; Co., Publishers
of <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>, have also an engraving of
me, which they will furnish for twenty-five cents
on application.</p>

<p><i>Frank</i> from Massachusetts. Dear little Blossom,
I am glad to put your name on my roll. It
isn't an easy matter to mind "just as quick!"
It takes a boy with a good deal of strength of
purpose to accomplish it. I am so glad you
have decided to learn the lesson early. Did you
ever hear of the great general who said no man
was fit to command until he had learned to obey?
It is true.</p>

<p><i>Paul</i> from Maine. My boy, I like your rules
very much; and your letter. I have just been
writing to a dear little fellow who has the same
fault to overcome; he will be glad to see you
have joined his company. Are you acquainted
with a namesake of yours, the grand old "Paul"
of the Bible? He is a favorite character of
mine. If you have not carefully studied his life,
suppose you do it, and write out what you think
of him, for me. Will you?</p>

<p><i>Marguerite</i> from New York. Yes indeed, my
little Daisy, you may join our society. We are
glad for all the flowers we can get, and we hope
they will bloom summer and winter, and be so
sweet that all who come near them will feel
their influence. I am glad you like "Reaching
Out." It is to be continued through the year.</p>

<p><i>Harold</i> from Boston. I hope the badge
reached you safely. At first I was in great
doubt, having received a nice letter from you,
with no address, so the badge could be sent;
but as soon as the second letter came, I attended
to it. To "mind mother" is one of the very
important duties in life. So important that
God made a special command about it. I think
you write an excellent letter for a boy of your age.</p>

<p><i>Lucy</i> from Michigan. Thank you, my dear,
for your interesting letter. I think your Band
must be a very helpful one. One needs to do
something of that sort, in order to realize how
rapidly the pennies count up.</p>

<p><i>Jessie</i> from Nebraska. So you are just a little
inclined to "fret." Well, that is a very easy
thing to do, and rather a hard thing to stop doing.
I hope the badge will do its share in the
work. I suspect the motto, however, will be
more helpful than anything else. I enjoyed
your letter very much.</p>

<p><i>Maud</i> from Montana. Oh, yes, my dear, far-away
Pansy, there are other Blossoms just as far;
but if somebody should ask us what we were
talking about&mdash;how far from where?&mdash;what
should we tell them? This is such a big world,
and the people who live in California think the
people who live in Maine are very far away from
them, but when I get a letter from a little missionary
girl in China, she says, "I wish you did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
not live so far away from <i>us!</i>" so how shall
we count? The truth is, we are all away from
home, on a journey; by and by, if we keep the
right road, we shall all get home to our Father's
house; then no one will be far away.</p>

<p><i>Horace</i> from New Jersey. My boy, I know
all about that habit of yours, what a temptation
it is. I am rejoiced to think you are going to
conquer it while you are young. One day I
went to call on two ladies, sisters, who were
both over fifty years old, and don't you think the
younger one contradicted the elder in almost
every statement she made! If we could have
gotten hold of her when she was a little girl, and
coaxed her to take a pledge to overcome the
habit, she would not be such an ill-bred woman
now.</p>

<p><i>Cora</i> from New Hampshire. We welcome
you and "sister Mabel" with great pleasure.
There are a great many "hasty tempers" among
our Blossoms. The world will certainly be the
sweeter because of all the flowers that have decided
to speak gentle words instead of hasty ones.</p>

<p><i>Rose</i> from Pennsylvania. Did the badge
help? I wonder what sort of things you "forgot"
so much? Poor gold thimble! I wonder
where it is hiding? I heard of a boy who forget
to mail a letter for his father, and so was the
means of his losing ten thousand dollars!</p>

<p><i>Rodney</i> from Philadelphia. Another "quick"
temper! All right, my boy; we have many to
keep you company. We welcome "sister Clara"
also. An "answer back" is almost certain not
to be a "soft" answer; did you ever notice it?</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">My Dear Pansy</span>:</div>

<p>Do you know I have read you for over three
years, and I think you are <i>just splendid!</i> I
want a badge to help me overcome the fault of
fretting. When things don't go to suit me I am
apt to fret. Near this town where I live there
are prairie dog-towns, where prairie dogs, owls,
and rattlesnakes all live together in one hole! I
should think they would fight and kill each other,
and I expect they do. I learned that piece from
<span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>, "The Little Quaker Sinner." I
think it is real pretty. I like the story about the
Deckers best of anything in <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>, but I
like everything in it. I take the magazine to
our school, and the teacher reads the story about
Nettie and Jerry, aloud; the scholars all like it
so much they can hardly wait until the next
chapter comes. I have a brother named Paul.
I would like to correspond with some Pansy

<h2>HOW SUCCESS IS WON.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Is</span> there a Blossom among you who does not
want to win success? I am sure I hope
not. There is an old saying, into which is
packed a deal of common sense. This is,
"What has been done, can be done." Since
there is truth in it, would it not be well for all
who want to succeed, to study those who have
succeeded? To this end, I want to introduce
the Pansies to a book bearing the title which is
at the head of this article. It is written by
Mrs. Sarah K. Bolton of Cleveland, which name
you will know, when you grow older, if you do
not now, ensures it as delightfully written and
worthy of all trust. A copy of the book lies on
my desk at this moment. There is a sense in
which it is not of much consequence how a book
is dressed, and yet I do like to see one in a
pretty dress, don't you?</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 280px;">
<img src="images/illus79.jpg" width="280" height="396" alt="photograph" />
<div class="caption">DR. J. H. VINCENT</div>
</div>
<p>This one is robed in a lovely gray tint, very
like the color which used to be called "ashes of
roses;" ask your mamma if she remembers
that. It has an exquisite design in gold, representing
the ocean, a ship riding its waves, a
lighthouse streaming out its warning of rocks
ahead, and a hint of harbor in the distance.</p>

<p>As to size, there are two hundred and forty-five
pages clear type, with very good pictures of
twelve grand men who were eminently successful
in their various fields, and a brief sketch of
each, given in Mrs. Bolton's inimitable style.</p>

<p>One of the faces is like the one I give you in
this article&mdash;John H. Vincent. I would be
glad to have all the Pansies acquainted with
the man. Many hundreds of you have seen him
at Chautauqua; I hope many thousands more of
you will go there, and see and hear him. I believe
he has more sympathy with, and heart for,
and knowledge of young people, than any other
great man whose name I know. These things
being true, of course he can help young people,
if they will let themselves be helped by him.</p>


<p>Who else is in the book? Oh, Whittier, the
grand old poet, and Gough, the temperance
orator, and Wanamaker, the Christian merchant
and philanthropist, and Edison the great inventor,
and Morton, whom so many of the sick and
suffering have reason to bless, and half a dozen
more whom you may not know quite so well by
name, but will enjoy meeting.</p>

<p>I am anxious that the Pansies in their youth
gather books about them which will not have
to be cast aside as outgrown in a few months,
but can be given honorable places on their
library shelves when they are men and women.</p>


<p>This is why I am watching the books, and
giving you their names, and a hint of their contents,
and getting special rates for you. Now
I have reached the remaining question of importance,
viz., price. Regular price, one dollar; to
members of the P. S., whose names are regularly
enrolled on our list, sixty cents. Send to
D. Lothrop &amp; Co., Boston, if you are entitled to
the book at that price.</p>

<p>JAMES VICK, seedsman and florist (Rochester,
N. Y.), sends out a "Portfolio of Rare
and Beautiful Flowers." The choice of the subjects
comprising the six large plates, painted from
nature, is a most happy one; and the accompanying
descriptions and history of these exquisite
forms, in verse and prose, reflect great
credit upon the editorial work. We predict for
it a generous reception.</p>

<h2>THE PANSY SOCIETY<br />

P.S.</h2>



<div class='drop-cap'>THE motto of the Society is "Pansies for Thoughts." What kind of thoughts? Oh, sweet, good, pure, unselfish,
hopeful thoughts, such as Pansies, beautiful Pansies ought to inspire.</div>

<p>Now "who may join?"</p>

<p>Every boy and girl who takes the <span class="smcap">Pansy</span>, and is willing to promise to try to overcome his or her faults, to
encourage every good impulse, to try to conquer some hard lesson at school, to do anything that shows a disposition
to help the cause of right in the world. Any one who will say from the heart: "I promise to try
each day to do some kind act, or to say some kind word that shall help somebody;" honest effort will be accepted
as much as if success were gained.</p>

<p>This promise must be dated, and will be copied into the "P. S." roll-book.</p>

<p>The most important of all to remember is our whisper motto: "I will do it for Jesus' sake."</p>

<div class='center'>
<b>"FOR JESUS' SAKE."</b><br />
</div>

<p>Whatever He will own, the "P. S." will be proud and glad to copy on its roll-book.</p>

<p>Then you must write a letter to Pansy (Mrs. G. R. Alden, Cincinnati, O.), saying that you thus pledge
yourself, and you will become a member of the Pansy Society, and receive a badge.</p>

<p>Now, about the badges.</p>

<p>The officer's is of satin, trimmed with gilt fringe, and has a gilt pin to fasten the badge to the dress or coat.
In the centre is a pansy in colors&mdash;above it the words, <i>Pansy Society</i>, and beneath it, <i>Pansies for Thoughts</i>.</p>

<p>The badge for members will be the same as the officer's, with the exception of having no fringe and a silver
pin.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Pansy</span> will help. As it has always been glad to encourage those who are struggling up toward the
light, so now it reaches forth its helping hand to those little ones who will rally bravely around it, to the work
of putting down the evil, and the support of all things good and beautiful.</p>

<p>So many of you have little brothers and sisters who want to join the P. S., and who of course do not need
an extra copy of the paper, that we have concluded to receive all such, letting them pay ten cents each for
their badges, if they wish them. Understand! If you are a subscriber to <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>, and have a badge, and
have a little sister who would like a badge, write at her dictation a little letter to Pansy, taking the pledge,
telling of some habit which she means to try to break, and enclosing twelve cents in two-cent stamps, ten to
pay for the badge, and two to pay the postage for sending it. Her name will be enrolled as if she were a subscriber.
The same advice applies of course to little brothers. Send your letters to Mrs. <span class="smcap">G. R. Alden</span>,
Chapel Street, Walnut Hills, Cincinnati, O.</p>

<p>It is also asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>What makes an officer of the Pansy Society?</p>

<p>You are to endeavor to organize a club of as many members as you can. Each one forming such a Club or
Society will receive the Officer's badge, and become President of the same. The local Society may contain as
many members as can be secured.</p>

<p>Then, of course, you will plan for your Society; how often it shall be called together, and what your rules
shall be; whether you will sing, or visit, or work, or have a literary society, or read a book. The only thing
you call on the members to positively promise is that each will try to overcome some bad habit, and will take
for the whisper motto the words&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
<b>"FOR JESUS' SAKE."</b><br />
</div>

<p>Each member of the "P. S." is invited to write to the editor, Mrs. G. R. Alden (Pansy), Cincinnati, O.,
how far the trial has proved a success, how many temptations have been resisted, how much progress in any
direction has been made, etc., feeling sure of encouragement and loving help.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pansy</span> has extra pages each month under the heading, "The Pansy Corner," in which Pansy holds
monthly talks with her correspondents. There is ample space in the corner devoted to interesting items connected
with the Pansy Society; also letters from its members.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alden would also be pleased to know how the members are getting on&mdash;what they are reading, studying,
talking about, etc., and whether the badges are helping them to keep their pledges.</p>

<div class='adtitle2'>WONDER STORIES OF SCIENCE.</div>

<div class='center'><b>Price, 1.50.</b></div>

<p>To improve as well as to amuse young people is the object
of these twenty-one sketches, and they fill this purpose
wonderfully well. What boy can fail to be interested in
reading an account of an excursion made in a balloon and
a race with a thunder-storm? And is there a girl who
would not enjoy an afternoon in the Christmas-card factory?
It is a curious fact that only one hundred and thirty years
ago the first umbrella was carried in London, much to the
amusement of the ignorant, and now there are seven millions
made every year in this country. And who would believe it
possible that there was a large factory full of women who
earned their living by making dolls' shoes. A bright girl
or boy who insists to know something about the work done
in the world, who does it, and how it is done, cannot fail
to enjoy these stories. The writers are all well-known
contributors to children's periodical literature, and the book
will be a welcome addition to any child's library, and might
be used with advantage as a reading book in schools.</p>

<h3>ARTISTIC FAC-SIMILE REPRODUCTIONS OF
ORIGINAL PICTURES.</h3>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-d-art.jpg" width="40" height="33" alt="D" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi4">DESIRING to bring within reach of all homes Pictures of real charm and real art value, we began,
October 1st, the publication of a series of superb fac-simile reproductions of the finest original
pictures belonging to the <span class="smcap">Wide Awake</span> magazine.</div>

<p>This collection of water colors, oil paintings, and line drawings, gathered during the past ten years,
includes fine examples of eminent American and foreign artists: Walter Shirlaw, Mary Hallock Foote, Wm.
T. Smedley, Howard Pyle, Henry Bacon, Jessie Curtis Shepherd, Harry Fenn, F. S. Church, Chas. S.
Reinhart, Miss L. B. Humphrey, F. Childe Hassam, E. H. Garrett, F. H. Lungren, H. Bolton Jones,
St. John Harper, Miss Kate Greenaway, George Foster Barnes, Hy. Sandham, and others.</p>

<p>And while the skill of foremost engravers has enabled us to give in the magazine many beautiful engravings
from these originals, the mechanical limitations of the graver, and of the steam press, render these "counterfeit
presentments," at their best, but disappointing attempts, to those who have seen the originals with their
greater delicacy and richness and strength. The real touch of the artist's brush, the finer subtler atmosphere,
the full beauty and significance, and the technical excellence, is missing&mdash;and it is these features that are
retained in these fac-similes.</p>

<p>The method of reproduction employed is the new photogravure process of the Lewis Co., which in result
is only equalled by the famous work of Goupil &amp; Cie of Paris. Each impression is on the finest India paper,
imported expressly for this purpose, and backed by the best American plate paper, size 12x15 inches. Only
a limited number of hand proofs will be made. Ordinary black inks are not employed, but special pigments
of various beautiful tones, the tone for each picture being that best suited to emphasize its peculiar sentiment.</p>

<p>These beautiful fac-simile reproductions are equally adapted for portfolios or for framing. They are
issued under the name of</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/wa-artprints-smaller.jpg" width="300" height="37" alt="WIDE AWAKE ART PRINTS" />
</div>

<p>Along with the unfailing and refined pleasure a portfolio of these beautiful pictures will give, attention
is called to their educational value to young art students, and to all young people, as the photogravure process
preserves each artist's peculiar technique, showing how the drawing is really made, something that engraving
largely obliterates.</p>

<p><i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Wide Awake Art Prints</span> <i>are issued on the first and fifteenth of each month, and are regularly
announced in the magazine.</i></p>


<div class='center'><b>SPECIAL.</b></div>

<p>Keeping in view the interests of our readers, we have decided not to place the Art Prints in the hands of
agents or the general trade. In this way our patrons are saved the retailers' and jobbers' profits, so that
while these beautiful works of art, if placed in the picture stores, would bear a retail price of $3.00 to $10.00,
we are able to furnish them to our readers and patrons at a</p>

<div class='center'>
<span class='gesp'>UNIFORM NET PRICE OF ONLY FIFTY CENTS EACH.</span><br />

<p>Orders for half-yearly sets of twelve will be received at $5.50 in advance; and for yearly sets of twenty-four
at $10.00 in advance. All pictures are sent in pasteboard rolls, postpaid. Half-yearly and yearly subscribers
will receive each monthly pair in one roll. Portfolios, suitable for holding twenty-four or less, will be
supplied, postpaid, for 75 cts.</p>

this past year. While its short stories and beautiful pictures have made it welcome everywhere as a
general Magazine for Little Folks, its series of instructive articles have rendered it of unrivalled value
to educators. For 1886 several specialties have been prepared in accordance with the suggestions of
teachers who wish to start their "little primaries" in the lines on which older brothers and sisters are
being taught. As a beginning in American History, there will be twelve charming chapters about</div>

<div class='adtitle3'>How we are Governed.</div>

<div class='unindent'><b>By Anna Laurens Dawes.</b> 12mo, $1.50.</div>



<div class='blockquot'><p>The task undertaken in this work by the accomplished daughter of Senator Dawes, has been to present
an explanation of the constitution and government of the United States, both national, State, and local, in so
simple and clear a way as to offer to the masses everywhere such an opportunity for their study as is not afforded
by the numerous volumes in which such information is chiefly to be sought. She has accomplished
her aim with remarkable success, and her book will have a hearty welcome from the thousands who appreciate
the need of it.</p></div>


<div class='adtitle3'><b>Lilith: the Legend of the First Woman.</b></div>

<div class='unindent'><b>By Ada Langworthy Collier.</b> 12mo, $1.00. <span class="smcap">Gilt edges</span>, $1.25.</div>


<div class='blockquot'><p>In this book, which is characterized by rare brilliancy of expression, beauty of thought, and tenderness
and pathos in sentiment, and which is withal as intensely interesting as any recent work of prose fiction, the
accomplished author presents a poem based upon the Rabbinic legends that Eve was not Adam's first wife,
but that she had a predecessor in the world's first Eden, who bore the name of "Lilith." The poem, based
upon these legends, cannot fail to establish the writer's reputation as an exceptionally able writer of verse, a
reputation which she has already gained as a writer of prose.</p></div>


<div class='adtitle3'><b>Boy Life in the United States Navy.</b></div>

<div class='unindent'><b>By H. H. Clark.</b> 12mo, <small>ILLUSTRATED</small>, $1.50.</div>


<div class='blockquot'><p>If there is anything in the way of human attire which more than any other commands the admiration
and stirs the enthusiasm of the average boy of whatever nation, it is the trim uniform and shining buttons
that distinguish the jolly lads of the "Navy." In this graphically written and wonderfully entertaining volume,
boy life in the Navy of the United States is described by a navy officer, in a manner which cannot fail to
satisfy the boys.</p></div>

<div class='unindent'><b>By His Sister</b>; <small>WITH PORTRAIT</small>, 380 <small>PAGES</small>, $1.50.</div>


<div class='blockquot'><p>Simply told and remarkably interesting is this story of the life of one of the most saintly of Christian men.
It will be welcomed and read with satisfaction by all who knew him. Those who never saw him, cannot fail
to be stimulated by its suggestive thought.</p></div>


<div class='adtitle3'><b>Money in Politics.</b></div>

<div class='unindent'><b>By Hon. J. K. Upton.</b> <span class="smcap">Late assistant secretary of the united states treasury.
Extra cloth, top.</span> 12mo, $1.25.</div>


<div class='blockquot'><p>This volume presents a complete history of money, or the circulating medium, in the United States, from
the colonial days to the present time. Mr. Edward Atkinson, in his introduction, pronounces it the most valuable
work of the kind yet published.</p></div>


<div class='adtitle3'><b>Baccalaureate Sermons.</b></div>

<div class='unindent'><b>By Rev. A. P. Peabody, D. D. LL. D.</b> 12mo, $1.25.</div>


<div class='blockquot'><p>These sermons, delivered before the graduating classes of Harvard University, it is safe to say, are not
excelled by any production of their kind. They are not only rarely appropriate, as discourses addressed to
educated young men upon the threshold of active life, but are models of logical thought and graceful rhetoric
worthy the study of all ministers.</p></div>


<div class='adtitle3'><b>What's Mine's Mine.</b></div>

<div class='adtitle3'><b>Boys' Heroes.</b></div>

<div class='unindent'><b>By Edward Everett Hale.</b> <span class="smcap">Reading Union Library.</span> 16mo, <span class="smcap">Illustrated</span>. <span class="smcap">Price</span>, $1.00.</div>

<div class='blockquot'><p>This handsome volume unites the charm of the <i>Arabian Nights</i> with the solid value of an Encyclopædia.
In its twelve chapters, Dr. Hale gives careful and definite account of a dozen famous characters the boys of
all ages have agreed to regard as heroes, but about whom their information is often neither full nor accurate.</p></div>

His sympathetic appreciation of American institutions, together with his eloquent eulogy of the life and character
of General Grant, recently delivered in Westminster, have greatly quickened American interest in all
